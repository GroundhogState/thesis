To-do list:
# 00_abstract.tex
	[] Write abstract
	[] Ensure list is up to date
# 00_frontmatter.tex
	[] Acknolwedgements
# 10_overview.tex
	[] Make sensible; precis = thesis outline
	[] Prologue = context/history of the field/where this thesis fits in
# 11_introduction.tex
	[] Waiting for Andrew comments
# 12_apparatus.tex
	What would it take to finish this chapter today?
		[] Build table for laser params. OK to leave AO freqs empty. Can get those this week. Or today if you're quick.
		[] 
		[] Whenever a general discussion is presented, ensure it closes with a direct connection to the experiment with adequate specifications.
		[] check math.
		[] specify amounts
		[x] this; dig out zeeman code
		[] how to get number from sat fluro
	Things to check in lab:
		[] RF cooling squence
		[] Focus: Is it just a pair of coils? I thought there was one on each window...
		[] He source HV values
	Done Tue 0608
		[x] Define I_sat back in theory somewhere...
		[x] Caption this figure and link with the text. Add pictures of detector elsewhere.
		[x] Maybe include a figure showing this dark rate?
		[x] So what parameters do we use for our atom lasers then?  All this background is fine, but in a chapter on the experiment you need some more details of what our system actually has
		[x] Properly caption apparatus figure
		[x] Define far-field.
	Done Mon 0607
		[x] Fix references; generally a big task. Standardize citation formats with py script!
		[x] Remove all parts relevant to lattice build; explain purpose of chapter clearly
		[x] evap cooling paragraph
		[x] Determine structure for this chapter and next; amend introductory paragraph. 
	Done Tue 0602
		[x] Complete master laser caption
		[x] MCP-DLD schematic
		[x] basic mechanism of laser cooling in brief
		[x] Remove the disparaging parts of this...
		[x] Remove above para and fix flow
		[x] description of TCP lock protocol
		[x] (cancel) diagnostic figure
	Done mon 0601
		[x] Move AO suite to lattice chapter, simplify (/present only one arm?)
			PMD: Moved diagram, reduced schematic, added legend. 
		[x] Caption distribution optics
		[x] One of these was done downstairs
		[x] by blocking line of sight to the MOT
		[x] be more specific, as the Zeeman effect is used all over the place
		[x] point to schematic
		[x] remove minutes claim or show some data
		[x] define what this is
		[x] Also, if it was close to resonance then you couldn't use AOMs to generate all the different frequencies we need for the many cooling and trapping beams
		[x] double check unused channel
		[x] Probably need  a bit more detail in teh caption, especially as it doesn't all seem to be in teh main text.
		[x] Maybe put maintenance after this as it's defined the sat fluro, which is better than just a diagnostic, you can make accurate number measurements with it
# 13_lattice_build.tex
	[] Find the balance between digression (for motivation's sake) and cohesion with the Overview chapter
	[] Heavy edits on motivation
	[] Double-well system example? Wannier function and ED code?
	[] Incorporate optical diagrams properly
	[] Description of dipole optics
	[] Diagram and samples of absorption imaging
	[] Discussion and pictures of build
	[] Use the line `In this section we deal with the nuts and bolts (literally) of assembling a cold-atom machine'
	[] Tales of dipole alignment; abs img 'comet', the 'cleft' and prior misadventures, dipole beam profiling, reason lattice beam not locked
	[] More to say/cite about correlation functions and the many body problem, callback to quasiparticles/emergent stuff...
# 20_metrology.tex
	[] Dig out Zeeman code, plot some egs
	[] How state-of-the-art theory works, the contributions from experiments. Add citations. Look over the ol Pachucki papers etc for primary refs. 
	[] Some context about the history of precision spectroscopy - lift from later chapter? Put tuneout section in context, at least with a couple sentences, but approach distinctly later
	[] orientation dependence goes somewhere in here (eg near the $5\triplet D$ section?)
# 21_transitions.tex
	[] Shorter title or fix page headers
	[] Put figures in the right place
# 30_manybody.tex
	[] Possibly don't need this section. But could pare down significantly to give context. Just need to discuss the QD chapter.
	[] How would you observe this?  What would it look like?
# 31_depletion.tex
	[] Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?
	[] cite more experiments
	[] Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?
	[] txy-to-vel vs linear error?
	[] CHECK THIS 3.
	[] Clarify \& graph of dark count statistics
	[] Worst-case bias of -1 counts
# 40_conclusion.tex
	[] Actually write a conclusion i.e. summary and outlook for the various themes and the field in general.
