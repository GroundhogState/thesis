My group&apos;s endlessly thankful to Chris Vale and the team from Swinburne for letting us hang on to this for over a year and do not one, but three measurements with it - see my poster for our tests of QED using this setup. The upshot is we lock the M-squared TiSaf laser with a software loop referenced to a high-finesse wavemeter, calibrated to a Cesium transition. We fibre couple the laser from generation table to insertion optics, where we have a photodiode for intensity control, and optics to control polarization and focus of the beam before entering the vacuum chamber."/>

First, a 1064nm seed is doubled by second-harmonic generation to 532nm, which is used as the pump beam for a tunable titanium-sapphire laser with a variable output that we operate within the 800nm range. This is doubled again by a nonlinear crystal to around 400nm. A fraction of the light is fed into the two ports of a High Finesse WS8 wavemeter, which we periodically calibrate with respect to a two-photon transition in a Cesium cell. This gives us a monitor for our software lock which is stable to 100kHz. We use the first diffracted order of an AOM to regulate the intensity of the light with respect to a photodiode placed after the output of the fibre that couples the laser generation table to the vacuum entry window. The profile and polarization of the beam are controlled with waveplates and lenses after a polarizing beam splitter. A translation mount on the final lens gives us micrometer precision in the placement of the focal point on the beam, which we use to align the beam on the trap, threading a ten micron needle in the dark 20 micro-radian accuracy."/>

Our multi-channel plate detector is a 2D array of electron multiplying channels, which provide sufficient gain to detect the resulting electron cascade on a delay-line detector. We can use broadband radio pulses to free some atoms from a trapped condensate, producing a pulsed atom laser, a train of coherent matter waves.

This ensures a nice large atom number and low temperature. This give us a nice big phase space density, a dimensionless number which compares the length scale of quantum interference, the de Broglie wavelength, with the interparticle spacing given by the particle density n. So, disturbances to this initial condition by atom loss or heating will reduce the phase space density input to the evaporation stage. The Bose-Einstein condensation threshold occurs when the phase space density crosses about 2 - for comparison, atmosphere has a phase space density about one ten millionth of that. One can therefore think of the RF evaporation as a phase space amplifier in the following way:"/>
<node CREATED="1578461775401" ID="ID_1682310251" MODIFIED="1578464946881" TEXT="Evaporative cooling works by creating a resonance between trapped and untrapped magnetic states of atoms with a specific Zeeman splitting by exposing the cloud to radio frequency radiation. Energetic atoms travel up the magnetic field gradient, shown by the thickness of the purple lines, to the ellipsoidal shell defined by a fixed field strength at which the atoms resonate with the radio waves. The atoms are then transferred into free states and leave the trap, taking with an amount of energy greater than the ensemble average. This basically cuts out the upper tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, driving down the atom number, but also the temperature once the cloud rethermalizes. If you get this right, you continuously increase the phase space density by making the cloud cooler and smaller, until you get to BEC. The endpoint of the RF chirp fixes an upper bound to the energy of the trapped atoms, and hence a temperature. Then the phase space density can be estimated by counting the number of atoms you have left. We measure this atom number using Helium&apos;s unique detectability - by applying broadband radio pulses to the trap we free about 0.5% of the atoms at a time, creating a series of pulses of coherent matter waves, known as an atom laser. This resolves on our detector as a series of discrete particle detection events, which we sum up with an abacus."/>

This follows the MOT loading and precedes evaporative cooling, and operates with XYZ beam parameters for XXX ms, and then with ABC beam parameters for YYY ms. I calculate that during these stages, the excited-state population is ZZZ per cent, which are then susceptible to scattering photons from the probe beam."/>

Tuning a radio chirp to the spin-flip transition from a trapped to an untrapped state and sweeping down to lower energies, higher-energy atoms are removed, the cloud rethermalizes at a lower temperature, and the phase space density increases.        Higher-energy atoms spend time further from the centre of a harmonic magnetic trap. So, scattering photons from the probe beam heat the cloud, leading widening the velocity distribution, which drives more of the atoms into resonance with the radio chirp. The final temperature is determined by the endpoint of the radio chirp. Resonance with the probe light manifests as a signal in a reduction of the final population of the condensate."/>

Although the uncertainy in wavemeter accuracy was larger than the transition linewidth, by operating well above the saturation intensity, the transition was broaded by tens of MHz and so the WM error was  less significant. When scanning the beam pointing across the expected target region, approximate alignment was signaled by a dramatic loss of atom number. When the signal saturated, the power was lowered until the signal was just above the noise floor, and then scanning resumed. This process iterated a few times until the maximum attainable signal was below saturation - that is, when for fixed power one could not completely destroy the trap. Notice there are three kinds of saturation here: Atomic population saturation, detector saturation, and signal saturation when you run out of atoms. perhaps the term &apos;dynamic range&apos; would be more suited to the latter... Something to think about."/>

At the moment I use an interpolation, but I might want to try using a model-based estimate of the atom number. Either way, there is going to be some error in the number estimation. It&apos;s probably small. The difference between the interpolated, unperturbed atom number and the detected number in the measurement trials is affected by the quantum efficiency and the introduced uncertainty in atom number."/>

Can you tell handedness just by relative angle of waveplates? We hypothesized that the initial state of the atoms during the cooling phase was in the m=2 state, as the optics are configured to drive with a sigma+ beam during the in-trap cooling stage. I verified this by driving with plane-polarized light (in the atom frame - put some trap sim in to show where the field points), which is a linear combination of sigma+ and sigma- light. If there were atoms in initial states other than the m=2, then when driving to the 53S1 state, one would observe multiple peaks. Instead, only one peak was observed, which vanished when the probe beam was set to sigma+ light. (I think check the data)."/>

For example, if you switch the electron in Hydrogen for a Muon and measure the respective Lamb shifts, you can determine the radius of the proton and find that it&apos;s different in each case.
