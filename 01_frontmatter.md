## Abstract

## Acknowledgements	

Well, this is about the time I start collecting some nice things to say to people who've stuck around. There will no doubt be more to add in future as I reflect on people's contributions.
I guess I don't need to mention ALL THE FRIENDS. Likely they won't read them. So maybe just include in the final draft submitted for feedback.

* Acknowledge the APS for financial support, and the ANU RSPE for financial and material support, LPC for the equipment and travel support, Piotr Deuar for arranging my visit to Warsaw and for extensive if intermittent collaborations
* Tim for the support in ventures both in research and in social philanthropy.
* Sean, Andrew & Ken for technical advice, and doing their best with what ultimately turned out to be a pretty difficult PhD. Thanks for taking me to Europe, I guess, but that did turn out to be a not so efficient trip. Was fun though. 
* David - for a compassionate ear, for infectious curiosity, for being a partner in crime for the rebellious act of self-studying from Schmacher & Westmoreland. You are painstakingly meticulous and that is something to learn from. 
* Bryce - I seem to learn something new from you each day. You struck me as very knowledgeable from the day I met you back when I was an aspiring theorist. Your attention to detail is maddening and yet I do find myself trying to learn from you in this sense. Your intuition is infuriatingly good, even if your arguments don't always stack up. Indeed you are the experimentalists' experimentalist. I daresay I picked up some bad work habits from you, but by the same token I have a great deal to thank you for in the conversations that brought me down to earth from hating the project, or whatever else was bothering me.
* Inger and V for their incisive wisdom, for elevating the soul, for helping me remember to believe in myself.
* To the kids across the pond - Richard, Jess, Patrick, Ethan - for the hikes and the hijinks.
* My housemates Morgan and Alice - the sage advice on surviving a PhD and how to make good decisions was good. Also knowing it was survivable. Seeing Alice's outward panic counterbalanced by her sticking of the landing in a most wonderful way - very good.
* To the humans outside the academy - Clair & Ridley for welcoming me to community (if complicated) - Brett and Erica for reminding me that my brain is something worth being excited about, Holly for the support in the early days and also some much-needed frankness about careers and relationships


To the inner circle, if you will - the life-support team.
* Geoff - for always thinking bigger
* Shane - for genuinely caring and checking in 
* Aqeel - for the counsel, and courting dropout but affirming bullish determination.
* [probably to redact in whole or in part, or individualize] - Hannah, Karlie, Leana, Holly - all of whom taught me about research and its place in the world


The readr team:
* Prithvi for being around. For putting up with my bitching. 
* Lauren.

* Josh - for reminding me that my various panics are not only normal but survivable

To my parents
