To-do list:
#{11_introduction.tex}
	[] {As a general comment, focus a bit more on what you actually did and include details that are important to your thesis rather than general information or speculation.  Quite often you will talk about some concept generally, which is fine to start with as long as it is concise, but then you won't include any of the specifics for our experiment, so the reader doesn't know what the actual parameters we use actually are!}
	[] {Clarify/check logic}
	[] {Consider better separating atomic structure and atomic interaction if possible, maybe just some extra headings}
	[] {orientation dependence goes here}
	[] {Aren't the numbers for quantum states J, $m_J$ for helium?  Just make sure it's consistent between the intro and the spectroscopy chapter.}
	[] {Flesh out the below and/or move modern calculations to spectroscopy section, add citations as appropriate}
	[] {Might make more sense after BEC?}
	[] {why is $a_{11}
	[] {cite}
	[] {as in... there isn't any meaningful $m_f$?}
	[] {Neither atom is excited after PI}
	[] {Why is this spacing so huge?}
	[] {this sentence doesn't add much}
	[] {I'm pretty sure the ionisation rate for excited-excited state is something like 5 orders of magnitude greater than for ground states, so this Penning process will dominate.}
	[] {notation probably not necessary; maybe in a footnotes explaining the scat len equivalence}
	[] {Can a field really become and industry?}
	[] {based on BEC technology}
	[] {The arguments that superfluids and neutron stars are BECs is why the field is normally referred to as BEC in dilute atomic gases}
	[] {Maybe you could be a little clearer with this explanation - talk about how below this critical value the de Broglie waves overlap}
	[] {I don't quite follow your arguments here... are you saying dilute gases may not be BECs, or that Penrose-Onsager theory may not be valid, or both?}
	[] {should this be an approx sign rather than a proportional sign?  Doesn't really make sense to me what you are saying as written}
	[] {I don't quite understand why this follows from replacing the operators with complex numbers}
	[] {Bose enhancement re: scattering into the	ground state. }
	[] {The last couple of pages I feel you could add a little more insight in terms of simple physical pictures of what is going on behind some of the maths.  What you have isn't wrong and is perfectly fine as is, but a couple of simple physical insights can add a lot. }
#{12_apparatus.tex}
	[] {[??] was done downstairs}
	[] {basic mechanism of laser cooling in brief}
	[] {Not necessarily true - there are plenty of zeeman slowers for other atomic species longer than the downstairs zeeman slower.  Even so, most of that is to do with the light mass of He - most atoms requiring a zeeman slower come out of an oven, which may be at temperatures of the high hundreds of degrees, which is far hotter than what comes out of our source (essentially LN2 temperature)}
	[] {it's whole purpose is kind of for differential pumping - the small solid angle is to select atoms with low transverse velocity while rejecting (i.e. differentially pumping) everything else.}
	[] {this is not standard... rephrase or ?}
	[] {by blocking line of sight to the MOT}
	[] {be more specific, as the Zeeman effect is used all over the place}
	[] {It doesn't really ensure they are resonant, because you have to consider their velocity too, more that it increases the scattering probability by creating a spatially varying restoring force. (I'm sure you could explain that in a better wording)}
	[] {point to schematic}
	[] {Is it just a pair of coils? I thought there was one on each window...}
	[] {remove minutes claim or show some data}
	[] {insert doppler cooling explanation, probably in earlier section. }
	[] {define what this is}
	[] {Also, if it was close to resonance then you couldn't use AOMs to generate all the different frequencies we need for the many cooling and trapping beams}
	[] {double check unused channel}
	[] {Put this later/after the main exp schematic}
	[] {This schematic is hard to follow, as it's hard to see what beam path is which.  Also, I'm not sure what information it conveys, given that each beam is essentially a copy of the others (in terms of the functional information this diagram shows).  You'd need to label things like AOMs, waveplates etc and probably highlight each beam in different colours or somehting for it to be useful, but I'd probably just not include it. }
	[] {description of TCP lock protocol}
	[] {Probably need  a bit more detail in teh caption, especially as it doesn't all seem to be in teh main text.}
	[] {double check that waist size. I think it was actually smaller, on the order of the TF radius}
	[] {Maybe put maintenance after this as it's defined the sat fluro, which is better than just a diagnostic, you can make accurate number measurements with it}
	[] {Maybe include a figure showing this dark rate?}
	[] {MCP-DLD schematic}
	[] {Put figure closer, but keep on opposing pages}
	[] {So what parameters do we use for our atom lasers then?  All this background is fine, but in a chapter on the experiment you need some more details of what our system actually has}
	[] {More axis labels and ticks and such... But they're all common...}
	[] {Without the reader knowing about atom lasers, they may think that these images look even more saturated than teh BEC!  The spatial profile certainly looks much worse.  You should at least mention that mean-field effects cause several types of distortion, and cite our earlier papers.}
	[] {This paragraph is typical of a lot of this chapter - a general introduction and vague description, but no specifics as to what we actually do!  E.g. from this I'd assume we have Ti subs on both machines.  Remember that your thesis is meant to talk about what you did, and this chapter in particular should describe the machines you worked on much more than provide a general introduction to the experimental aspects of BEC machines.}
	[] {put figures closer to references}
	[] {These diagrams are pretty confusing... At least you need to add some labels to parts of the vacuum system, different beams etc.  A legend showing different components might help too.  In general, a diagram such as this trying to show every optical component isn't very helpful - the reader doesn't need to know about every lens and mirror in every beam path!}
	[] {Probably just make this chapter exclusively about the BiQUIC machine. Differentiate the machines in the lattice chapter.}
	[] {Remove above para and fix flow}
	[] {diagnostic figure}
#{30_manybody.tex}
	[] {How would you observe this?  What would it look like?}
#{31_depletion.tex}
	[] {Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?}
	[] {cite more experiments}
	[] {Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?}
	[] {txy-to-vel vs linear error?}
	[] {CHECK THIS 3.}
	[] {Clarify \& graph of dark count statistics}
	[] {Worst-case bias of -1 counts}
