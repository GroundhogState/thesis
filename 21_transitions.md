# Transition measurements	
## Gap	
	Helium spectroscopy
	Vassen & Martin
## Aim & scope	
	Test limits of sensitivity & check Martin
## Contribution	
	Three methods, six lines
	Direct A measurement
		Other measurement methods of oscillator strengths
		Existing best precision & motivation
		Uh what do you learn from these?
	QED seems fine
## Method: 
n=5	
	Three-level theory & model
		
	Sequence
		How does evap affect temp? Use a simple model, though our sequence is bunk.
		Just need a heuristic explanation - hopefully theres a 'we can't determine exact relationship' in there somewhere. 
	Analysis
Forbidden	
	Theory & predicted SNR
	Sequences
	Analysis
## Issues	
	Power & curvature measurements
	instrumentation
	Didn't actually test QED
## Next?	
	Isotope shifts & better reference
	Different targets?
