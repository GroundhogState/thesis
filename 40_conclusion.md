###A critical reading of science
Technology evidently brings us great things. But let us not lose sight of the implicit 'right to know' - that we still embody the notion of a conquest over nature, of mastery of the other, the greater, the ultimately incomprehensible. Let us not fall victim to our own arrogances, and recall that in our turbulent times, our investigations come at cost. The nature of reality will, according to our ultimate foundations, remain. But the conditions of society in which we have the ability to pursue them are not guaranteed. One can never predict the outcomes of discoveries, or what miraculous things may be born of new technologies, but in the problem of allocating compute power from human wetware - which still retains a certain je ne sais quois that has not been replicated by industrial-scale algorithms running in silico - we should be mindful of the hubris of endless pursuit of the mastery of nature. This remains ingrained in our mythology - that more advanced technology is always worth the price that is paid. In the limit of free, clean energy and post-scarcity manufacture whereby human labour is eliminated, this may be true. But, unlike the atoms in this thesis, we do not live in vacuum.
