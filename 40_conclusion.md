# Conclusion	
## Revision of key findings		

This thesis describes work that consists of the following scientific contributions:
	* Martin was wrong
	* New lines
	* Weakest transition
	* Test of QED
	* Partial resolution of QD which didn't answer much and isn't decisive re: theory
	* work towards a new regime of condensed matter simulation

## Outlook	
* future specroscopy - prospects for helium 3
* Lattices - possible directions
* Quantum correlations & foundations experiments

## Afterword
A personal reflection.
Was lured in to the academy by the promise of questions like 'what is the difference between simplicity and complexity' - when are things simple? When is something intrinsically hard to represent, even if it exists effortlessly in its own right? This drew me to lattice - to build something with the hands that would be so elusive for theory and computing. But yeah - that might have been possible, but I hadn't the background to make reasonable progress in the three year timeframe of an Australian PhD. Also, frankly, I didn't have the tuition or support and so was left alone for most of the time, crushing motivation and without praise and squirreled my time away in a simulation that was much more to my theoretical tastes. But hey. I have to find a nice way to dress this up. Most of these words won't make it. So having got these ones out of the way, the hope is that I can move on from them and think more deliberately about what it is that I would say here. 

The chronological order of work is reversed. I should perhaps detail the actual sequence of events - and frame them as pragmatic decisions from which I learned some useful things about scoping projects properly. There isn't really much that window dressing can add here. But that's okay - rather than telling the entire truth, just tell enough of it. But don't let the complexity frighten you out of doing your best to be honest, at least in this tiny sliver, the final vestiage of the self-expression that you'd hoped you'd find the opportunity to explore. This has been an exercise in shedding the ego, however incomplete that process may yet remain. 

###A critical reading of science
Technology evidently brings us great things. But let us not lose sight of the implicit 'right to know' - that we still embody the notion of a conquest over nature, of mastery of the other, the greater, the ultimately incomprehensible. Let us not fall victim to our own arrogances, and recall that in our turbulent times, our investigations come at cost. The nature of reality will, according to our ultimate foundations, remain. But the conditions of society in which we have the ability to pursue them are not guaranteed. One can never predict the outcomes of discoveries, or what miraculous things may be born of new technologies, but in the problem of allocating compute power from human wetware - which still retains a certain je ne sais quois that has not been replicated by industrial-scale algorithms running in silico - we should be mindful of the hubris of endless pursuit of the mastery of nature. This remains ingrained in our mythology - that more advanced technology is always worth the price that is paid. In the limit of free, clean energy and post-scarcity manufacture whereby human labour is eliminated, this may be true. But, unlike the atoms in this thesis, we do not live in vacuum.
