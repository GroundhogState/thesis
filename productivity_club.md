	# What did I want to do today?
		* Get to the bottom of different defns for contact density and square with published results
		* Finish re-deriving expression for total contact
	# Where did I work?
		* Home 'office' in my lounge
	# What I did today (with rough hours)?
		Didn't track hours
		Looked for courses to tutor next sem (for the $$$) and organized for car to be towed to mechanic :(
		Sorted out point 1 above, gelling definitions with existing results. In other words, found the missing factor of 2. Made progress towards total contact density but the units of my integral are wrong so something's still fishy. Getting real close!
	# How many hours did I work?
	# How focused was I /10 and any notes
		Trending from 7 down to below 4ish later in the day.
		Should probably have stuck to plan and exercised before lunch for a refresh.
		Motivation was ok when things were working out, but faltered later in arvo, see mood notes below
	# Was this thesis work /10 and any notes
		I mean, yes. Working towards paper which is part of process, but thesis.tex no changes
	# What went well today?
		Getting the hang of mathematica again, actually using its functionality rather than just as a glorified notebook. Also 
	# What was hard today?
		Staying motivated after finding Rockson Chang's quite good notes on his QD experiment, and being a bit floored by BMH's work on QD trap release sims
	# How did my mood trend today?
		Started out farily optimistic if dazed (did not quite catch up on sleep from late nights on the weekend). Was satisfied with contact theory progress, but grew more frustrated and self-deprecating later in the day. Mood improved after a short exercise in the loungeroom with Charlotte.
	# What I'm excited to do tomorrow?
		Not much, at first thought. Feeling disheartened at various levels. 
	# What not keen to do tomorrow?
		See above. Bludge through this project that I was stoked to move on to, only to be bludgeoned a bit on the first day I picked it back up in earnest.
	# How can I make tomorrow better?
		Find something to look forward to. Well, this theory stuff does need to be finished and my mind is kind of on it for now. But if/when I notice persistent negative feelings about it, I will step away and find a different task. 
		Maybe I can spend some time on 'side productivity' like cleaning up some repos/merging core_BEC branches.

		Same same
	# What I did today (with rough hours)?
		Had some issues with main code after updating. Not sure what features changed.
		Either way - got through that, still feels a bit like a wasted ~5ish hours.
		Got my head around correlators, too. Tried generating some fake data - bimodal with b-b pairs in the wings. Indeed, the correlator picks them out just fine. But with low efficiency it suffers badly. Ran ~1300 shots through, took about an hour - and nothing conclusive. Would like to understand the result a bit more but this is a low priority right now.
	# How many hours did I work?
		~6.5 hrs, didn't really log rigorously.
	# How focused was I /10 and any notes
		6.6/10 - managed to stick it OK most of the time, but distracted between pomodoros
	# Was this thesis work /10 and any notes
		4/10 - would have been a great result, but not in 'minimum viable' and I don't really mention correlators anywhere else in the thesis so sadly not very relevant.
	# What went well today?
		Getting the damn system to work took long enough
	# What was hard today?

	# What I did today (with rough hours)?
		Procrastinate pretty hard. Starting to get caught up a bit with COVID news, feeling like things are inevitably going to get bad here. Started doing silly things like ballparking the probability that one of my family members is hospitalized. Built a piss-poor model of cases in Australia and made some predictions. Anyone wanna make some bets?
		I did read Eli's paper, which was blessedly only slightly informative - looks like I haven't missed anything in my previous surveys. Some good insights for sure.
		I also did get my QD code spinning again (again with the weird 2 hour shift in the logfile timestamps... Time zone thing? idk.) But hit some more bugs so got a bit discouraged.
		Also, I did a short Rings workout and set up a website: http://groundhogstate.github.io/.
	# How many hours did I work?
		Uh. On actually useful stuff, probably 2-2.5...
	# How focused was I /10 and any notes
		4/10 very distractible. 
	# Was this thesis work /10 and any notes
		4/10 see above
	# What went well today?
		Well, QD still, for the most part, runs. And the website is live, heh.
	# What was hard today?
		Staying focused.
	# What not keen to do tomorrow?
		Continue bug hunting in code that worked fine last I ran it in the office...
	# What I'm excited to do tomorrow?
		Step 2: Goof with correlators for a bit as 'bait.'
	# How can I make tomorrow better?
		Go to bed right after this log. And probably stop working earlier tomorrow.

	# What did I want to do today?
		Get back on the wagon. Spent the last few days in a flurry of coding, making figures, triple-checking calculations and tables, etc. Basically, incorporating Sean's comments.
	# Where did I work?
		Same as recently - granny flat office.
	# What I did today (with rough hours)?
		Well, I was up after midnight last few nights, so this morning I spent lazing in bed then went out for breakfast. Started looking around for blog hosting platforms. Also in some downtime over the last few days I have been looking into other banking/investement options, but probably not the best time to move on that now all the indices have been crashing LOL
		I didn't really keep track of hours, but:
		* Updated figures (took a few iterations to get right)
		* Quadruple-checked expt and theory values in Results table of spectroscopy paper
		* Found some papers about line-narrowing
	# How many hours did I work?
		Uhh, 6-8, I forget. I didn't log the programming work I did. It's too easy to fall into a flow state and feel the need to stay engaged. Would be worth experimenting with deliberately breaking those sessions up - can be hard to maintain the discipline to NOT work.
	# How focused was I /10 and any notes
		Varied through the day. Found papers but couldn't really read them. Coding/figure work was easy to focus on - I guess it was well-defined tasks.
	# Was this thesis work /10 and any notes
		10 - again, mostly focused on paper, but it's all content that will go in eventually...
	# What went well today?
		Got through almost all the suggested text changes, and *verified the damn results table* (but still a little anxious about getting an entry wrong lol)
	# What was hard today?
		Remembering what I did! This is why a) sleep is good and b) logs are usefulAlso I keep planning to do a 'progress review', meant to do them weekly but haven't done one yet. Friday is my last day on Spectroscopy (other than specific tasks to move along the paper, I am moving on to QD to put my mind on something else), and will take a day off between, so maybe in there will be a good time to review the progress and process.
	# What I'm excited to do tomorrow?
		Spend a few hours reading about proton radius measurements
		Learning about line narrowing
		Go have a BBQ with my friend and meet her cat :)
	# What not keen to do tomorrow?
		Probably discovering I have a pile more theory to do? I mean, interesting, but I don't want *longer* to-do lists.
	# How can I make tomorrow better?
		Go to bed after this report! Get good sleep, and respect the structure of the day.

	# How focused was I /10 and any notes
		Hmmm 8/10 in AM but back to 5/10 in arvo. Felt like a bit of a slog.
		I had a 'constructive procrastination' break which was actually very easy to attend to, more on that later
	# Was this thesis work /10 and any notes
		Ah, yeah, 7/10 as it was stuff that needs to go in but not actually much - mostly tables and to-do items, yikes
	# What went well today?
		Conquering clebsch-gordan nonsense.
		My late-night pomodoro actually took me all the way through reproducing Danny's calculations so I can get them going myself
		Also my silly side project, see below.
	# What was hard today?
		Staying focused in the afternoon. Still really twitchy in reaching for social media/distractions, but found that I was happy to pick up the guitar between stints. Shall aim for more of this.

		9 - During pomodoro maintained good discipline. Could have reduced intervals between work bursts, something to work on. Would need good task definition
	# Was this thesis work /10 and any notes
		7 - Yep, relevant stuff, and will contribute to content in thesis, but wasn't directly writing content
	# What went well today?
		My workout, lol. Feeling stronger already!
		But also, wringing the most out of the data/tables was a good bit of oldschool numerical work, which I have missed
	# What was hard today?
		Hmm, probably figuring out exactly what I wanted to ask Danny about moving on. And having the guts to ask before diving in instead of burning a day on working through theory that might take me down the wrong track! Fear of appearing stupid is something I am still unlearning.
	# What I'm excited to do tomorrow?
		If Danny gets back to me: Finising this darn thing and circulating a draft PDF!
		Will start to read a cool book about Helium in search of inspiration

	# Where did I work?
		Home office again
	# What I did today (with rough hours)?
		* Paper transcription took an embarrassingly long time. Document kept breaking because I missed a pair of {} in a paper title, but took me ages to figure it out. ~3 pomodoros with intermittent focus
		* Made some OK headway through the fine structure theory, but Danny's labeling is V confusing and I think one of the parameters he used was wrong. 3 pomodoro, very poor focus.
	# How many hours did I work?
		I mean, 3 if you count the pomodoro, but my focus was bad so inreality less than that.
	# How focused was I /10 and any notes
		3.5 - woke up tired/unrested, tried to take a nap about noon but couldn't sleep because of morning coffee. 
	# Was this thesis work /10 and any notes
		4 - needs to be done, but progress was slow
	# What went well today?
		Recognizing my poor focus and trying a few things to bring it back, even if they weren't successful.
	# What was hard today?
		Staying focused. Finding efficient solutions to fiddly problems.
	# What I'm excited to do tomorrow?
		Finish solving the splitting problem, even if that means re-doing some of Danny's work. Gotta explain it anyway. Might suck, but I think it can be *done* tomorrow.
	# What not keen to do tomorrow?
		Possible need to reproduce the calc Danny did - not sure if the notes he gave me cover it, so will have to go learn some atomic theory... Possibly less fun is removing the heavily redundant text from the chapter, despite my previous excitement. That might suck a lot because of the varied repetitions.
	# How can I make tomorrow better?
		Sleep well tonight. Work for a specific number of pomodoros on each task, and move on regardless of its status so progress is made on both. Delete distracting apps like Twitter (having already killed FB)
