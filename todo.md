Throughout the thesis, the author is missing a space between numbers and their associated units, e.g. 50 nm. This should be corrected.
JR: Peruse the text after making the other changes.
JR: The main factors distinguishing the experimental techniques are discussed in the new subsection Improvements upon measurement technique.
Ask Bryce re: measurement precision; I only seem to get 14x by comparing the (quadrature-summed) uncertainty (16 for linear sum)

chapter 1
	I believe some discussions of the real and the imaginary parts of the polarizability would be appropriate, especially their functional dependence on light detuning from an atomic resonance.  
	An atomic energy level diagram with singlet and triplet states would be very appropriate in this section as a reference point to fall back to. 
chapter 2
	The caption for Figure 2.1 is too long and very hard to follow- in particular in the absence of any subplot label, I did not know which of the beamlines I should be looking at while reading it. 
	JR: I have moved most of the caption to the main text. The figure has also been reworked for clarity: The beamlines have been split into distinct figures and given their own captions. Check the result
Fig 3.10 the caption and the diagram are too close to each other
chapter 4
	Can anything be said about the line strengths, maybe even the relative line strengths, of the transitions from these measurements?
	Fig.4.6 The description in the main text could be more elaborate.
	Spectroscopy chapter: The issue of the limitation of the dynamic range should be explained. Also the contradictory issues of SNR and saturation can be dealt with two different sets of measurements, right?
Chapter 5
	It is not initially obvious why a purely optical trap, rather than a combined hybrid trap is more suited for these measurements. My understanding is that this is related to the spin-sensitive pulsed detection of outcoupled atoms from the magnetic trap. This should be motivated in the measurement technique section.
	Similarly the reason why BECs are used as opposed to cold thermal samples in these measurements should be explained.
	Is the anharmonicity of the dipole trap (inevitable for shallow dipole traps) a relevant factor?
	Section 5.3.1. The exclusion criteria. Only one in 10000 shots was rejected, so was this necessary or useful? JR: Probably not, but we havenâ€™t tested without
Chapter 6
	One small comment about physical models. The section of the power law fitting, perhaps unknowingly, gives the impression that one has to rule out all of the innumerably large alternative functional forms to establish one single functional form. This of course is not true, as there is usually a very small of set of physically motivated functional form.
	Fig 6.1: the caption encroaches into the diagram.
