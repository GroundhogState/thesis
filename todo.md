To-do list:
# 10_overview.tex
	[] What would you say the contribution of the QD work was? I've commented out my suggestion here.
	[] Get most recent citations
# 12_apparatus.tex
	[] Chapter with Andrew
	[] These are wrong, will fix
	[] Is this necessary?
# 13_lattice_build.tex
	[] Include \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03582-4
	[] Get coil specs
# 20_metrology.tex
	[] How state-of-the-art theory works, the contributions from experiments. Add citations. Look over the ol Pachucki papers etc for primary refs. 
	[] Some context about the history of precision spectroscopy - lift from later chapter? Put tuneout section in context, at least with a couple sentences, but approach distinctly later
	[] orientation dependence goes somewhere in here (eg near the $5\triplet D$ section?)
# 22_tuneout.tex
	[] QED and the proton radius
	[] Rewrite
	[] Classical oscillator intuition. Dipole force recap and extension. Why the real part? Go all the way to defining $\fto(-1,0)$ but save the ellipsometry for later. Perhaps: Materials analogy, susceptibility/polz/etc
	[] Comment on difference between magic and tune-out lattices for qsim/control
	[] Read these past measurements
	[] Make first paras a summary of method, incl. identifying f(-1,0), and then outline the rest of the section as detailed discussions of the key points
	[] Relationship to magic wavelengths, etc etc
	[] Compress, be clearer it's a summary, acknowledge theorists. Prioritize reformulation as zero in rayleigh scattering cross section.
	[] Ensure one has the $2\pi$s in the right places; I think I use rad hz here
	[] Longer caption text. Integrate with this section.
	[] is there a factor of 2 missing here?
	[] VALUE
	[] Fix table
	[] graphic showing key concepts in polarization part
	[] start here
	[] point out densities and coherences
	[] where we are going:
	[] Trap freq allan deviation?
	[] provide a couple
	[] update Caption, 
	[] Put polarization theory here and then explain the various stages of analysis.
	[] What was the intensity used in the experiment?
	[] Integral expression
	[] Not quite sure what this para is saying specifically. Don't rephrase, rewrite.
	[] Rework after analysis
	[] Rework or omit with reference
	[] Substantially rewrite this section in own voice in own framework. Finally put the math togther as you worked on before. Separate the polarization theory from the polarizability theory. 
# 31_depletion.tex
	[] How would you observe this?  What would it look like?
	[] cite more experiments
	[] Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?
	[] txy-to-vel vs linear error?
	[] CHECK THIS 3.
	[] Clarify \& graph of dark count statistics
	[] Worst-case bias of -1 counts
# 40_conclusion.tex
	[] Actually write a conclusion
