To-do list:
# 10_overview.tex
	[] What would you say the contribution of the QD work was? I've commented out my suggestion here.
	[] Get most recent citations
# 12_apparatus.tex
	[] Chapter with Andrew
	[] These are wrong, will fix
	[] Is this necessary?
# 13_lattice_build.tex
	[] Get coil specs
	[] Broken ref, maybe 'as shown in previous figure'
	[] This isn't clear
	[] What does this mean/is it necessary?
	[] How was this mitigated?  The mitigation you refer to in the next sentence is a completely separate issue!
	[] need to give numbers on this - what was your temperature in B trap, atom number, trap depth of ODT? etc
	[] Short explanation of why the trap tightness matters.	What values did we ahve for the old coils?
	[] Talk about some of the Bose-Hubbard physics before the additional upgrades
# 20_metrology.tex
	[] How state-of-the-art theory works, the contributions from experiments. Add citations. Look over the ol Pachucki papers etc for primary refs. 
	[] Some context about the history of precision spectroscopy - lift from later chapter? Put tuneout section in context, at least with a couple sentences, but approach distinctly later
	[] orientation dependence goes somewhere in here (eg near the $5\triplet D$ section?)
# 31_depletion.tex
	[] How would you observe this?  What would it look like?
	[] cite more experiments
	[] Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?
	[] txy-to-vel vs linear error?
	[] CHECK THIS 3.
	[] Clarify \& graph of dark count statistics
	[] Worst-case bias of -1 counts
# 40_conclusion.tex
	[] Actually write a conclusion
