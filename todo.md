To-do list:
# 00_abstract.tex
	[] Write abstract
	[] Ensure list is up to date
# 00_frontmatter.tex
	[] Acknolwedgements
# 10_overview.tex
	[] Make sensible; precis = thesis outline
	[] Prologue = context/history of the field/where this thesis fits in
# 11_introduction.tex
	[] Waiting for Andrew comments
# 12_apparatus.tex
	[] These are wrong, will fix
# 12_apparatus_test.tex
	[] Fix references; generally a big task. Standardize citation formats with py script?
	[] Whenever a general discussion is presented, ensure it closes with a direct connection to the experiment with adequate specifications.
	[] Properly caption this figure
	[] check math. Include specific laser intensities/detunings for some parts of the experiment.
	[] this; dig out zeeman code
	[] Is it just a pair of coils? I thought there was one on each window...
	[] how to get number from sat fluro
	[] Define far-field.
	[] Caption this figure and link with the text. Add pictures of detector elsewhere.
	[] Maybe include a figure showing this dark rate?
	[] So what parameters do we use for our atom lasers then?  All this background is fine, but in a chapter on the experiment you need some more details of what our system actually has
# 13_lattice_build.tex
	[] Find the balance between digression (for motivation's sake) and cohesion with the Overview chapter
	[] Heavy edits on motivation
	[] Double-well system example? Wannier function and ED code?
	[] Incorporate optical diagrams properly
	[] Description of dipole optics
	[] Diagram and samples of absorption imaging
	[] Discussion and pictures of build
	[] Use the line `In this section we deal with the nuts and bolts (literally) of assembling a cold-atom machine'
	[] Tales of dipole alignment; abs img 'comet', the 'cleft' and prior misadventures, dipole beam profiling, reason lattice beam not locked
	[] More to say/cite about correlation functions and the many body problem, callback to quasiparticles/emergent stuff...
# 20_metrology.tex
	[] How state-of-the-art theory works, the contributions from experiments. Add citations. Look over the ol Pachucki papers etc for primary refs. 
	[] Some context about the history of precision spectroscopy - lift from later chapter? Put tuneout section in context, at least with a couple sentences, but approach distinctly later
	[] orientation dependence goes somewhere in here (eg near the $5\triplet D$ section?)
# 21_transitions.tex
	[] Shorter title or fix page headers
	[] Put figures in the right place
# 30_manybody.tex
	[] Possibly don't need this section. But could pare down significantly to give context. Just need to discuss the QD chapter.
	[] How would you observe this?  What would it look like?
# 31_depletion.tex
	[] Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?
	[] cite more experiments
	[] Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?
	[] txy-to-vel vs linear error?
	[] CHECK THIS 3.
	[] Clarify \& graph of dark count statistics
	[] Worst-case bias of -1 counts
# 40_conclusion.tex
	[] Actually write a conclusion i.e. summary and outlook for the various themes and the field in general.
