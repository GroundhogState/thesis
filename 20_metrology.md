# Metrology

Metrology may be reasonably defined as the art of measurement. 

## Section introduction	

Quantum Electrodynamics, or QED, describes the interaction of charged particles with the electromagnetic field, whose fundamental excitations are identified with the more familiar photons, or particles of light. QED therefore describes the physics that governs all we see with our eyes, the interatomic forces from which arise the various familiar phases of matter, prevent solids from passing through one another, almost all technology (even nuclear physicists use electronic control and diagonistic technology), and indeed the dynamics of the action potentials in neurons. Hence, the purview of QED may well include the physics underlying the most intriguing of phenomena, perception. The detailed connection between quantum field theory and subjective self-awareness are beyond the scope of this thesis. For decades, quantum electrodynamics has stood unchallenged as the most accurate quantitative description of the world to date. Among its triumps include the prediction of the Rydberg constant to absurd precision and the correct prediction of the existence of antimatter. As the first synthesis of special relativity and quantum mechanics, QED laid foundations for more general quantum field theories, ultimately leading us to the standard model of particle physics. Undoubtedly, QED is a foundation stone in one of the great pillars of our understanding of the cosmos. However, as any sensible applied scientist will tell you: All models are wrong. QED, and QFT in general, presently has no formulation that is consistent with general relativity (other than in string theory, which despite its ambition and elegance has yet to satisfy experimental physicists). However, until we have the technology to synthesize black holes or other extreme gravitational conditions, we may not have experimental access to the high energy densities required to probe the Planck scale where quantum and gravitational effects are expected to be of comparable magnitude. Fortunately, we may not have to wait so long: The infamous proton radius puzzle, regarding the disagreement between experimental determinations of the proton charge radius, remains unresolved. Further, there remain statistically significant disagreements between predicted and measured energy levels in Helium. If there is an identifiable bias in theoretical predictions then, optimistically, one may find a legitimate need for physics beyond the standard model to explain these results. Therefore, experimental atomic physicists may find themselves prospectors for the fundamental discovery of the century. The experiments described in the following two chapters constitute searches for evidence to constrain the search space of theories that purport to resolve the ongoing disagreements. Before describing the aims, findings, and methods of the experiments, I will provide a short refresher on atomic theory, terminology, and notation that is relevant to the following results.
