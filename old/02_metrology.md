3	Transition measurements	Gap	Helium spectroscopy
			Vassen & Martin
		Aim & scope	Test limits of sensitivity & check Martin
		Contribution	
			Three methods, six lines
			Direct A measurement
				Other measurement methods of oscillator strengths
				Existing best precision & motivation
				Uh what do you learn from these?
			QED seems fine
		Method: n=5	Three-level theory & model
			Sequence
				How does evap affect temp? Use a simple model, though our sequence is bunk.
				Just need a heuristic explanation - hopefully theres a 'we can't determine exact relationship' in there somewhere.
