The third section of this thesis transitions from the study of atomic structure to the emergent dynamics of interacting systems. In teh old essay 'More is different', there is an argument that when you put a lot of thigns together they start acting in genuinely novel ways. A single water molecule is not wet - nor does it mean anything to say it is any given phase, or that is has a temperature. (this is of course problematic because it ascribes a specific state but the idea's there I guess). So ya. One of the watershed(?) moments in the history of physics was the *derivation* of thermodynamics from statistical mechancics - the assumption of a set of postulates about the microscopic nature of the world that led through the law of large numbers to a new understanding of empirical laws of the past; this gave a framework to understand and extend thermo, and it was a triumph to provide systematic ways to determine macro physics from teh nature of interactions. What was more profouond was the discovery of universality classes - that at phase boundaries there were unifying properties across disparate systems, things that tied together quite general phenomena in terms of these scaling relationships. This is kind of garbled. But yeah, look, we have agaaghagha this is just insane rambling - I wonder if I can push to 10k words in the process of smooshing out all this. Not an entirely honest drive if I'm honest but w/e the thing is I'm here and I'm writing even if it's completely useless and will get trashed. This is a start, even if it's bogus and hard. Anyhow back to progress. So ya - statistical mechnics also provided an actual understanding of temperature as a sublime phenomenon in all the emergent phenomenon - that really, at the end of the day, thermal equlibrium and the 'spontaneous' processes we see in nature are just outcomes of, basically, the law of large numbers. Phase transitions have been noted in all kinds of places now; the BEC transitiion is a classical phase transition. The idea is that an *order parameter* changes value from zero - representing a kind of disorganization - to something nonzero, representing an emergent order. These come in different flavours and in different systems but tied together by their scaling laws - universality classes. Something really beautifully profound there. And of course, pepole have tried to take the numinous idea of the phase transition, of the *qualitative* change in the emergent properties of otherwise unchanged constituents, just by fiddling how they relate to each other - and staple it to all kinds of things. People talk of phase transitions in general network theory, presumably in social dynamics, and more recently even in the study of grammars, arguing that meaningful language corresponds to a marked phase transition in lexical trees. But turning back from flights of fancy - thermodynamics unified these ideas (in the earlier days) with the idea of *Free energy* which has since run rampant. But the idea is that - well, if you have tunable parameters, then are there different solutions to some equation? How do you wind up with these multiple free-energy landscapes from a microscopic basis? Or do you need to staple models toether? Idk, this would have been a great topics for a PhD, hey? 

Regardless. The idea is that we should probably add more signposts to this meandering mess. I want to lead from classical phase transitions to order parameters - using BEC as an example, identify its universality class, no need to list off a ton or ramble about them too much. Then say hey, once you're in the ground state, you have different kinds of phase transitions. Quantum phase transitions, which aren't driven thermally or by statistical laws but by the structure of the gruond state, and they were first observed in an optical lattice. Free energy comes up as should correlations, I think, as they both come hand in hand with order etc.
