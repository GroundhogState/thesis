To-do list:
# 11_introduction.tex
	[] Clarify/check logic
	[] Consider better separating atomic structure and atomic interaction if possible, maybe just some extra headings
	[] orientation dependence goes here
	[] Add citations for dipole trap history
	[] Aren't the numbers for quantum states J, $m_J$ for helium?  Just make sure it's consistent between the intro and the spectroscopy chapter.
	[] Flesh out the below and/or move modern calculations to spectroscopy section, add citations as appropriate
	[] Might make more sense after BEC?
	[] why is $a_{11
	[] Braun13
	[] this sentence doesn't add much
	[] should this be an approx sign rather than a proportional sign?  Doesn't really make sense to me what you are saying as written
	[] I don't quite understand why this follows from replacing the operators with complex numbers
# 12_apparatus.tex
	[] [??] was done downstairs
	[] basic mechanism of laser cooling in brief
	[] by blocking line of sight to the MOT
	[] be more specific, as the Zeeman effect is used all over the place
	[] point to schematic
	[] Is it just a pair of coils? I thought there was one on each window...
	[] remove minutes claim or show some data
	[] define what this is
	[] Also, if it was close to resonance then you couldn't use AOMs to generate all the different frequencies we need for the many cooling and trapping beams
	[] double check unused channel
	[] Put this later/after the main exp schematic
	[] description of TCP lock protocol
	[] Probably need  a bit more detail in teh caption, especially as it doesn't all seem to be in teh main text.
	[] Maybe put maintenance after this as it's defined the sat fluro, which is better than just a diagnostic, you can make accurate number measurements with it
	[] Maybe include a figure showing this dark rate?
	[] MCP-DLD schematic
	[] Put figure closer, but keep on opposing pages
	[] So what parameters do we use for our atom lasers then?  All this background is fine, but in a chapter on the experiment you need some more details of what our system actually has
	[] put figures closer to references
	[] Remove above para and fix flow
	[] diagnostic figure
# 30_manybody.tex
	[] How would you observe this?  What would it look like?
# 31_depletion.tex
	[] Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?
	[] cite more experiments
	[] Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?
	[] txy-to-vel vs linear error?
	[] CHECK THIS 3.
	[] Clarify \& graph of dark count statistics
	[] Worst-case bias of -1 counts
