Examiner 1

	While I understand the references in the overview would be out of order, I don’t understand why the references start at [144] in chapter 1, personally I dislike this, as it feels clumsy. I would suggest re-ordering these, unless there is some underlying reason that I’ve not picked up on.

	Personally, I think chapter 3 is not required, as it adds no new science. Instead, it shows that the student worked on another project for some time, which is unnecessary considering the excellent results. I feel it breaks the overall flow of the thesis and could be relegated to an appendix or excluded entirely without harming the outcome of the thesis. Whether to change this or not is left to the author and supervisor.

	Throughout the thesis, the author is missing a space between numbers and their associated units, e.g. 50 nm. This should be corrected.

	page 54: I would add a figure here from the Ref. [108] showing the magnetic coil
	configuration. Given the other illustrative diagrams in this chapter, it seems out
	of place to leave out a diagram of the magnetic trapping, especially given its
	prominence in the later results chapters.
	page 133: I thought that similar to the previous chapter, where the publication is
	cited, you should mention the arXiv paper here in a footnote. In particular, I
	thought it necessary to highlight the “equal contributions” of the first and second
	authors (this could also apply to the original listing of the publication at the
	beginning of the thesis as well).
	page 136: “We achieve a 20-fold improvement in the precision over the sole
	previous measurement”. It took me some time to realise that these were earlier
	results from the same group (although I was familiar with the previous
	measurement of the tuneout wavelength done at ANU). This should be better
	highlighted here (it does end up being more transparent in the conclusion
	chapter).
	page 141/142: General comment, as above: It would be great to emphasize the
	experimental improvements that have led to the improvement in this
	measurement, as it is not very transparent how these measurements are a
	refinement of the previous ones at ANU. As written, it seems like there is worry
	that it will make the results of this section appear incremental – but that is the
	essence of precision measurement anyways, and it is clear from the subsequent
	sections that a meticulous study was undertaken. This could be done with a few
	brief sentences in these sections (or on page 136), similar to (but with a bit more
	detail) to how this is discussed in the conclusion section. As written at the
	moment, the detail of each of the techniques is well documented, but there is no
	high-level summary of how these collective improvements that led to the 20-fold
	improvement in the measurement. As a final comment, the improvement is
	alternately noted as “25 times” in the conclusion, perhaps this should be
	consistent throughout.
	page 190: section 6.2.1: Throughout this section I was unclear on how the
	condensate is excluded from the fitting analysis. Perhaps I have missed this, but
	some clearer explanation is needed.



Examiner 3
	chapter 1
		I believe some discussions of the real and the imaginary parts of the polarizability would be appropriate, especially their functional dependence on light detuning from an atomic resonance. 
		An atomic energy level diagram with singlet and triplet states would be very appropriate in this section as a reference point to fall back to.
		a more diagrammatic approach would probably be more useful.

	chapter 2
		The caption for Figure 2.1 is too long and very hard to follow- in particular in the absence of any subplot label, I did not know which of the beamlines I should be looking at while reading it. 
		I also suggest that the theory of laser cooling given in the subsection named ‘Cooling Techniques’ is moved to Chapter 1
		there would certainly be scope to use diagrams to explain things better and save words in section 2.3

	Chapter 3 
		Unfortunately I think that this chapter undermines the flow of the thesis. The motivation for
		optical lattices is given is the first two sections, which I think should have found their place in
		chapter 1 (theoretical background). Section 3 describes the painstaking work undertaken to
		realise the optically trapped helium atoms with a great deal of experimental details, while
		section 4 gives a brief outlook. I think sections 3 and 4 of this chapter would be best given as
		a chapter before the Conclusion (Chapter 7), as a prelude to the future experiments in this setup
	chapter 4
		• In the measurement technique section, it is not clearly stated that probe and the pump
		beams are on simultaneously to induce atom losses. I think it should be made clear.
		Also the duration of the pulse (100ms) seems excessively long to me for the scattering
		rates (is the pump beam resonant?). It would be good to check.
		• Is there an advantage of the measurement technique used here over direct optical
		detection of the atom number post/prior to evaporation? This should be discussed.
		• Are BECs required, or just a convenient means to reduce broadening? This should be
		discussed.
		• ‘Calibration shots’ are mentioned. The sensitivity of the final atom number with respect
		to the initial atom number can be tested by varying the former while keeping the
		evaporation sequence fixed. Is that what is meant by the calibration? Please explain.
		• Can anything be said about the line strengths, maybe even the relative line strengths, of
		the transitions from these measurements?
	Chapter 5
		The theory of the polarizability near the tune out point and its polarization
		dependence is given in two subsections, which I found to damage the flow of the chapter. I
		suggest that these discussions are either moved to chapter 1 (theoretical background) or given
		in a separate section in this chapter
		It is not initially obvious why a purely optical trap, rather than a combined hybrid trap
		is more suited for these measurements. My understanding is that this is related to the
		spin-sensitive pulsed detection of outcoupled atoms from the magnetic trap. This should
		be motivated in the measurement technique section.
		• Similarly the reason why BECs are used as opposed to cold thermal samples in these
		measurements should be explained.
		• Is the anharmonicity of the dipole trap (inevitable for shallow dipole traps) a relevant
		factor?
	Chapter 6
		One small comment about physical models. The section of the power law fitting,
		perhaps unknowingly, gives the impression that one has to rule out all of the
		innumerably large alternative functional forms to establish one single functional form.
		This of course is not true, as there is usually a very small of set of physically motivated
		functional form.
