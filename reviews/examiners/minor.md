	Prologue
	1. page 0: Spectrometry --- > spectrometry.
	2. page 0: Page numbering starts on “0” instead of “1”, seems odd.
	3. page 3: Footnote 3, “Planck” not capitalised.
	4. page 11: extra space after He*.
	Chapter 1
	1. page 17: “Hydrogen”, “Helium” written with caps, should be lowercase.
	2. page 26: footnote – “we consider -- Doubly” --> “we consider. Doubly…”.
	3. page 28: “coefficiencts” misspelled.
	4. page 39: typo in GPE, should be “i \hbar” on left, rather than “-\hbar”.
	Chapter 2
	1. page 44: “bell-type” --> “Bell-type”.
	2. page 44: “413nm” --> “413 nm”.
	3. page 50: In the footnote the statement is a bit confusing as worded – it seems to
	imply that a collimated beam will converge to a focus.
	4. page 51: Eq. (2.2), the subscript “lab” should not be italicised.
	5. page 53: Missing space between number and unit in “2mm” and “1cm”.
	7. page 58: In the footnote, “analogoous” misspelled.
	8. page 59: Bad latex reference resulting in “??” partway down the page.
	9. page 63: “19.8eV” missing the space before the unit.
	Chapter 3
	1. page 80: Latex float issue(?) leading to a large space in the page.
	2. page 84: similarly, a large space here.
	3. Page 88: “One of the most accessible lattice systems to realize with ultracold
	atoms is the Bose-Hubbard model.” – the wording is strange, just a typo(?) Bose-
	Hubbard is not a lattice system? Reword.
	Chapter 4
	2. page 134: “section 5.3gives” missing a space
	Chapter 5
	1. page 169: “in Tab 5.2” inconsistent with later usage down the page, “table 5.2”
	and also elsewhere where “Tab. XX” is used.
	2. page 173: figure shows power in mW, while the caption describes the powers in
	Watts. Would modify the figure axis to be consistent.
	3. page 181: “smallest precision” to “highest precision”
	Chapter 6
	2. page 208: Figure 6.8: From the text, it appears that these results are from the
	theory collaborators. They should be attributed in the figure caption.
	Bibliography
	There are several errors in the bibliography:
	1. page 224: Ref. [18], “Bose-einstein”; Ref. [19] “structure of scince”
	2. page 227: Ref. [63], “evidence,” should be capitalised, “condesnation”
	3. page 236: Refs. [174, 175] duplicate.
	4. page 237: Refs. [187, 188] duplicate.
	5. page 240: Refs. [229, 230] duplicate.
	6. page 241: Ref [237] “87RbD-line” missing space.
	7. page 249: Ref. [250], latex typo
	8. page 250: Ref. [351], typo “Optics COmmunications”; Ref. [353] formatting issues
Examiner 3

Chapter 2
	• pp 44 line 5, “Bell-type” typo
	• pp 45 line 4, “ molecular pumps” (extra fullstop)
	• pp 45 line 5, fullstop missing
	• pp 45 line 10, “faraday” should be Faraday. There are several more instances of this
	typo in this chapter.
	• pp 45 line 13, LVIS should be defined.
	• Fig.2.1 could be broken into two, each with a smaller caption.
	• pp 59, line “…chapters ??..”
	Chapter 3
	• pp 91: “a.k.a.”
	• pp 95: “faraday” should be “Faraday”
	• pp 95: Is ETP the name of the manufacturer of the part?
	• pp 103: “..1 0 ms delay ..” extra space in 10
	• pp 104: “Unforunately..”, second para, second line, typo
	• pp 104: “ NIM crate..” Is NIM defined?
	• pp 106: First sentence: a larger range of momentum states does not necessarily mean a
	large phase space density.
	• pp 107: “dipole fibers” is too colloquial.
	• Fig 3.10 the caption and the diagram are too close to each other
	Chapter 4
	• pp.119 “…photon scattering signal…” what is it?
	• Pp.121 “..transduction from photon scattering to…”, the word “transduction” means
	something different.
	• Fig. 4.3 Caption “Theory lines” do you mean the dotted lines? Also what are the vertical
	bars? Please mention that in the caption.
	• pp121-122 The issue of the limitation of the dynamic range should be explained. Also
	the contradictory issues of SNR and saturation can be dealt with two different sets of
	measurements, right?
	• Fig 4.3, 4.4, instead of cumbersome omega – 744…, could it be omega – omega_m,
	with omega_m defined in the caption and text to be 744…?
	• Fig. 4.5. (b) axis label, there is a THz, MHz mix-up.
	• The description of Fig.4.6 in the main text could be more elaborate.
	• Pp130, The RF linewidth of the crystal oscillator of 300kHz sounds excessively large.
	Please check.
	• Pp 126, uK in Roman font
	• There are several instances in the chapter where a ½ space between a number and a unit
	is missing (e.g., 1.4kHz in page 126).
	Chapter 5
	• pp 134. An energy level diagram would be apt to help follow the text. “Section 5.3
	gives…” needs a space.
	• pp 135. “The tune-out frequency, where an atom does not interact with applied laser
	light…”. It is not true that at tune out frequency atoms do not interact with light, in fact,
	the imaginary part of the polarizability does not cancel at the tune out point.
	• Pp 136. “An equivalent model can be constructed using an LC circuit - the object of
	ultimate interest is the equation of motion,…” sounds very strange.
	• Pp 151 “Connection to the experiment” should be emboldened (maybe just quote the
	section number).
	• Secion 5.2.2: The first sentence is a bit unintelligible.
	• Why was the probe dipole beam power not stabilized?
	• Section 5.3.1. The exclusion criteria. Only one in 10000 shots was rejected, so was this
	necessary or useful?
	• Fig 5.5 \omega_{net} is presumably an angular frequency, so one needs a 2\pi there.
	• Pp 167. \chi^2/dof ~ 1 needs a space.
	• Pp169: “ 1140(20) MHz” should not italicized
	• Pp 171: “also” twice..
	• There are several of instances in the chapter where a ½ space between a number and a
	unit/symbol is missing (e.g., pp178 “~30\sigma).
	Chapter 6
	• The term “far-field” should be defined somewhere early.
	• Fig 6.1: the caption encroaches into the diagram.
	• Fig 6.1: where is the inset stated in the caption?
	• Fig 6.2: Vertical scale unit should it be um^-3?
	• pp192: “…alternative approach presented in section 6.2.1”. It is section 6.2.1
	• pp 194: “especially” spelt wrong.
	• pp 197-198, the significance of p-value should be stated.
