% Well, this is about the time I start collecting some nice things to say
% to people who've stuck around. There will no doubt be more to add in
% future as I reflect on people's contributions. I guess I don't need to
% mention ALL THE FRIENDS. Likely they won't read them. So maybe just
% include in the final draft submitted for feedback.

% \begin{itemize}
% % \tightlist
% \item
%   Acknowledge the APS for financial support, and the ANU RSPE for
%   financial and material support, LPC for the equipment and travel
%   support, Piotr Deuar for arranging my visit to Warsaw and for
%   extensive if intermittent collaborations
% \item
%   Tim for the support in ventures both in research and in social
%   philanthropy.
% \item
%   Sean, Andrew \& Ken for technical advice, and doing their best with
%   what ultimately turned out to be a pretty difficult PhD. Thanks for
%   taking me to Europe, I guess, but that did turn out to be a not so
%   efficient trip. Was fun though.
% \item
%   David - for a compassionate ear, for infectious curiosity, for being a
%   partner in crime for the rebellious act of self-studying from
%   Schmacher \& Westmoreland. You are painstakingly meticulous and that
%   is something to learn from.
% \item
%   Bryce - I seem to learn something new from you each day. You struck me
%   as very knowledgeable from the day I met you back when I was an
%   aspiring theorist. Your attention to detail is maddening and yet I do
%   find myself trying to learn from you in this sense. Your intuition is
%   infuriatingly good, even if your arguments don't always stack up.
%   Indeed you are the experimentalists' experimentalist. I daresay I
%   picked up some bad work habits from you, but by the same token I have
%   a great deal to thank you for in the conversations that brought me
%   down to earth from hating the project, or whatever else was bothering
%   me. Maybe one day I'll find my way to something you haven't already
%   thought about.
% \item To the mentors of my past: David Thomson, Lorraine (?) Donaldson, Ian MacArthur, Darren Grasso.
% \item To those who have no idea how much they've helped me: Peter Bouwknegt, Uli Schollwoeck, Ian (lastname?)
%  \item For the more unusual company: Kass, John, Tim, and Arnagretta for repeatedly telling me to get the damn thing done.
% \item Technical staff - if I came away with any measurable fraction of your technical wizardry and finesse, I will be all the richer for it
% \item
%   Inger and V for their incisive wisdom, for elevating the soul, for
%   helping me remember to believe in myself.
% \item
%   To the kids across the pond - Richard, Jess, Patrick, Ethan - for the
%   hikes and the hijinks.
% \item
%   My housemates Morgan and Alice - the sage advice on surviving a PhD
%   and how to make good decisions was good. Also knowing it was
%   survivable. Seeing Alice's outward panic counterbalanced by her
%   sticking of the landing in a most wonderful way - very good.
% \item
%   To the humans outside the academy - Clair \& Ridley for welcoming me
%   to community (if complicated) - Brett and Erica for reminding me that
%   my brain is something worth being excited about, Holly for the support
%   in the early days and also some much-needed frankness about careers
%   and relationships
% \end{itemize}

% To the inner circle, if you will - the life-support team. * Geoff - for
% always thinking bigger * Shane - for genuinely caring and checking in *
% Aqeel - for the counsel, and courting dropout but affirming bullish
% determination. * {[}probably to redact in whole or in part, or
% individualize{]} - Hannah, Karlie, Leana, Holly - all of whom taught me
% about research and its place in the world

% The readr team: * Prithvi for being around. For putting up with my
% bitching. * Lauren.

% \begin{itemize}
% % \tightlist
% \item
%   Josh - for reminding me that my various panics are not only normal but
%   survivable
% \end{itemize}
