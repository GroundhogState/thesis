In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of all correlation functions of a system is equivalent to solving the corresponding many-body problem. Already a finite set of correlation functions can be sufficient to describe a quantum many-body system if correlations factorise, at least approximately. While being a powerful theoretical concept, an implementation based on experimental data has so far remained elusive. Here, this is achieved by applying it to a non-trivial quantum many-body problem: A pair of tunnel-coupled one-dimensional atomic superfluids. From measured interference patterns we extract phase correlation functions up to tenth order and analyse if, and under which conditions, they factorise. This characterises the essential features of the system, the relevant quasiparticles, their interactions and possible topologically distinct vacua. We verify that in thermal equilibrium the physics can be described by the quantum sine-Gordon model, relevant for a wide variety of disciplines from particle to condensed-matter physics. Our experiment establishes a general method to analyse quantum many-body systems in experiments. It represents a crucial ingredient towards the implementation and verification of quantum simulators.},

It is attributed to quark confinement, whose origin is not yet understood. The phase diagram for nuclear matter at general temperatures and densities, studied in heavy-ion collisions, is not settled. Finally, we have no definitive theory of high-temperature superconductivity. Though we have theories that could underlie such physics, we lack the tools to determine the experimental consequences of these theories. Quantum simulators may provide such tools. Here we show how to engineer quantum simulators of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. The systems we consider have several applications: they can be used to mimic quark confinement or to study dimer and valence-bond states (which may be relevant for high-temperature superconductors).},

While these phases were discovered in a solid-state setting, recent techniques have enabled the realization of gauge fields in systems of ultracold neutral atoms, offering a new experimental paradigm for studying these novel states of matter. This complementary platform holds promise for exploring exotic physics in fractional quantum Hall systems due to the microscopic manipulation and precision possible in cold atom systems. However, these experiments thus far have mostly explored the regime of weak interactions. Here, we show how strong interactions can modify the propagation of particles in a \$2\textbackslash times N\$, real-space ladder governed by the Harper-Hofstadter model. We observe inter-particle interactions affect the populating of chiral bands, giving rise to chiral dynamics whose multi-particle correlations indicate both bound and free-particle character. The novel form of interaction-induced chirality observed in these experiments demonstrates the essential ingredients for future investigations of highly entangled topological phases of many-body systems.},

We identify two dimensionless parameters: (re-scaled) Planck's constant and the ratio of the lattice spacing to the scale of variation of the external potential. We consider the special case where both parameters are equal and denote this parameter . In the limit {$\downarrow$} 0, we prove the existence of solutions known as semiclassical wavepackets which are asymptotic up to `Ehrenfest time' t {$\sim$} ln 1/ . To leading order, the center of mass and average quasi-momentum of these solutions evolve along trajectories generated by the classical Hamiltonian given by the sum of the Bloch band energy and the external potential. We then derive all corrections to the evolution of these observables proportional to . The corrections depend on the gauge-invariant Berry curvature of the Bloch band, and a coupling to the evolution of the wave-packet envelope which satisfies Schr\textasciidieresis odinger's equation with a time-dependent harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. It is demonstrated that this coupling of observables (discrete particle-like degrees of freedom) to the wave-envelope (continuum field-like degrees of freedom) can have a very significant impact on the overall dynamics. We show that the coupled `particle-field' system for the evolution of the observables and wavepacket envelope may be derived from an `extended' -dependent Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {Can high energy physics be simulated by low-energy, non-relativistic, many-body systems, such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles.},
