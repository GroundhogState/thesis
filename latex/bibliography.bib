Because the interparticle interactions determine emergent features, the study of ultracold collisions is interesting in its own right as a key part of the quest for finer understanding and manipulation of quantum systems. 
This is an exhaustive review!
Collisions in the sub-microkelvin regime are below the recoil energy of light and so must occur in the dark - this is the 'ultracold' regime.
Doppler and molasses temperatures are called Cold
Collision dynamics important to understand trap loss mechanisms; 3body and penning important for He
And indeed stability as negative scat len is unstable
Cross sections scale like (2l+1)/k^2 where k is the CoM wavevector (in terms of reduced mass), 
Can approx the magnitude of AM by the impact parameter and momentum, bp 
Penning rates are EVEN WORSE in a MOT because of S-P collisions, the latter of which are 14e-8 cm^3/sec vs 2e-9 cm^3/sec as calculated for the S state

He* can ionize any atoms except He and Ne, known as Penning ionization. The decay channel from two triplet He* atoms to a ground state He, ground state He+, and electron is an imporant loss mechanism. Another channel to He2+ and an e-, associative ionization, is also possible but less common

Pennig rates are of order 5e-9 cm^3/s at large detunings. In the dark, the rate constant is a factor of 50 lower.

Prediction of suppression
Total decay rate (ie rate constant x density?) is 1e9 cm^3/sec
Predicted 5 OoM suppression of penning ionization rate
note that critical temp can be written in terms of the density, which links intensive parameters instead of eg number
relaxation-induced penning; virtual spin-dipole transitions to the zero spin state of the quasimolecule can life the spin-conservation rule and lead to regular penning ionization
Direc dipole-exchange ionization is also a possibility but dominated by spin-relazation
He has a favourable ratio of elastic to inelastic collisions, which implies the prospect of reaching lower temps via evap, and the large scattering length suppresses the density and thus reduces a

The bogo approx amounts to replacing the a_0 and a+_0 field operators by complex numbers. This article proves that for reasonable interactions it gives exact values of the thermodynamic functions in the thermodynamic limit. 
For infinite systems, the condensation is not necessary for replacement of the k=0 field ops by complex numbers. Rather this follows from properties of the operator algebra.
The general idea here is to show that one can fix the value C (the mean-field/order parameter) to maximize the approximate pressure, which is asymptotically equal to the exact pressure. The soln C=0 is always available to the so-called 'condensate equation', which fillows from the Bogo approx of Hamiltonian. 
The gauge freedom is in the choice of the phase of C (the order parameter). The condensate equation yields only the magnitude, not argument. One can explicitly break the symmetry by adding a source term to the Hamiltonian [-sqrt(V) (\nu a+ + \bar{\nu}a)] where\nu->0 as V->\infty. The maximization described above can be done again, and the asymptotic equalities are still true. Then \nu is the argument of C.
Bogo approx applies even when BEC not present, but is only really of interest in such a case

Intuition; if the population is large, then the action of a or a+ are negligible. This is the same intuition underlying coherent states. One can then consider the bogo approx as the approximation of the one-particle occupation as \ket{C} = \exp(-|C}^2/2)\sum_{l\geq 0} c^l/\sqrt{l!} \ket{l} where l is num particles in the state; and so the entire Fock space can be written as states of the form \ket{\psi'\otimes C}. Then one can make the replacement <C|A|C> = A_0(C) which lets an operator on the whole Fock space be written like <\psi_1\otimes C|A|\psi_2\otimes C> = <\psi_1|A_0(C)|\psi_2>, which corresponds to swapping out the a_0 and a+_0 terms for C and C* in the appropriate operator expansion of A. 

It seems at a glance that when \nu=0, ie when gauge symmetry holds, then the average of C is zero (but the distribution of C is in fact a circle of radius sqrt{V}). When \nu\neq 0 then the expval of C will be of order sqrt{V} and have arg C \approx arg \nu, with small fluctuations in C. The former and latter cases correspond to the absence and presence of condensation. Ginibre then moves on with the proof of asymptotic exactness and says no more.
This average is taken wrt a prob dist that is formed from the bogo approx. partition function. Maximizing this function gives the value of C, as shown later in Lieb 2005

This paper proves
i. Ginibre's exactness result in a much simpler manner via more modern inequalities
ii. That the complex number substitution can be done for many modes, so long as fewer than O(N)
iii. The optimum z (ie. a0->z s.t. ???) in the presence of a gauge breaking term yields |z|^2 = |a0|^2 = <n_0>, which is the amount of condensation. (here n_0 is the number operator for the k=0 mode)

Hamiltonian in large box has second-quantized form
H = k^2 a*k ak + nu(p)a*(k+p)a*(q-p)ak aq/2V; einstein convention, hbar = m = 1, and nu(p) is the fourier transform of the two-body potential v(r).

So, re: condensate fraction, they show that <n0>/V is not necessarily a good estimate of the condensate density. Indeed <n0> = sum(n p(n0=n)), and p may not simply be sharply peaked near the actual n0; it could be flat up until a larger n0, or even peaked at zero! Unfortunate. The most reliable quantity is apparently lim lambda->0, V->infty <n0>_{lambda,mu}/V, with respect to a Hamiltonian H_{lambda,mu} = H_mu + sqrt(V) (lamba a0 + lambda* a0*) [ref. Bogoliubov 1947] - also mentioned as the symmetry breaking term in Ginibre, and this H_mu is the grand-canonical hamiltonian
H_mu = H - mu N = H - mu(a0* a0 + N^>)
where H is the form given above and N^> is the num of particles in nonzero mode
For almost all lambda, the density p(V rho_0) converges to a delta function at rho_0 = lim V->inf |z_max|^2V where z_max maximizes the partition function.

Spon Sym Breaking is when the hamiltonian (or lagrangian) obey the symmetry the ground state doesn't: So what *is* the symmetry that is broken, and can we write it down?
SSB generally involves considering the effect of a symmetry-breaking field in the thermodynamic limit; this field perturbs the system away from otherwise-stable macroscopic symmetries.
The SSB field here is introduced as a calculational tool and need not actually exist; indeed most things are considered in the limit of this field amplitude -> 0
But this limit does not commute with the thermodynamic limit! One needs to take TL and *then* shrink the SSB field. Otherwise, the symmetry remains in the TL
And thus in the TL, the symmetry is broken even for vanishing values of the field. This instability implies spontaneous SB in the TL; one could imagine the action of a small perturbation

Also yep, same defs of symmetry and SSB defined for the ground state of the system
The Landau picture uses symmetries to deduce long-distance behaviour near phase transition, rather than diagonalizing complicated systems
  But the Bogo approx lets us do this, so we didn't have to resort to more sophisticated tools...
  'invariably, the ordered phase is less symmetric'
Symmetry usually quantified by identifying an order parameter, an observable whose expval vanishes in the symmetric phase, eg ferromagnet
for continuous and spontaneously broken symmetries, a general consequence is the emrgence of gapless excitations known as goldstone modes (like spin waves in ferromagnets)
hm - ODLRO introduced in the context of non-number-conserving dynamics eg electron pairs interacting with a condensate of cooperpairs; so for the ground state <s|s+ s-|s> neq 0; which is manifesyl seen in the BCS wavefunction. Does this connect to the ODLRO seen in condensates also, does it connect to number fluctuations?
Under gauge transformations, the creation and annihilation operators have to transform like the wavefunctions in ordinary QM (meaning non-rel or?); this means the op goes like 
Psi_sigma -> exp(i q alpha) Psi_sigma
Psi_sigma^\dagger -> exp(- i q alpha) Psi_sigma^\dagger
, where q is the charge and alpha is the gauge parameter (seen earlier in this paper as the gauge added to the EM potential); so particle-number conserving equatiosn are gauge-invariant, but others like \Psi_up \Psi_down are not! Instead they pick up (in this case) twice the phase factor. The expectation value is typically real but then picks up a phase.
Then the order parameter itself must also pick up this phase factor! Thus it's *not* gauge-invariant and thus is not observable (the *magnitude* is invriant and thus observable, but the phase isn't. Sounds familiar). 
A note that <psi psi>, where psi is annh. operator, is typically zero; not so in the bogo picture...
Ah! 
  In the Landau-Ginzburg picture one expands the free energy wrt the order parameter and finds a stationary point; this yields the amplitude, but not phase, of the order parameter. It appears that the non-specified phase fixes a manifold of non-gauge-invariant ground states and that gauge symmetry is broken. But actually, this is not the case, and precisely the origin of the misnomer 'broken gauge symmetry' - which starts to look a bit like the condensate case where the order parameter has a form r exp(i phi). In fact this is a conspiracy between the covariance of the order parameter and the gauge redundancy.
  Indeed; these are just redundant descriptions of a unique ground state. This phenomenon is connected to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism by which the gauge field acquires a gap; that is to say, the gauge field becomes massive, and hence the 'photon acquires a mass' terminology in condensed matter

So... what is the gauge symmetry in BEC?

phase coherence at heart of bec
When particle number is not conserved, there can be large condensate mode population fluctuations, of the order of the mean. Condensates in the grand canonical ensemble have a g(2)(0) = 0. Do does phase coherence exist alongside large fluctuations?
When the number fluctuates to zero, the phase of the order parameter is lost. The output of a photon condensate in a cavity-dye reservoir it beat against a reference. Phase jumps are observed when the number flucutuations bring the condensate population near zero. When the population returns, interference resumes with a random phase 'as a result of SSB after spontaneous emission'
  Gives some sense to the sym breaking field; one can explicitly add a fluctuation term which kicks an atom into some mode? Hm - but was the sym breaking field for atom or quasipart?
The jump rate scales inversely with system size 
14 micron cavity has mode spacing of the order of the dye emission width
hm, so the cavity induces a low-energy cutoff well above thermal energy, hence introducing a chemical potential?

Photon condensation was challenged because they would just be absorbed into the walls; there was no lowest-energy mode where they would collect. 
Photon BEC is different from a laser in that the former is driven by gain, the latter by a phase transition which is possible when there is a number-conserving thermalization process.

abstract = {We have developed and characterised a stable, narrow linewidth external-cavity laser (ECL) tunable over 100 nm around 1080 nm, using a single-angled-facet gain chip. We propose the ECL as a low-cost, high-performance alternative to fibre and diode lasers in this wavelength range and demonstrate its capability through the spectroscopy of metastable helium. Within the coarse tuning range, the wavelength can be continuously tuned over 30 pm (7.8 GHz) without mode-hopping and modulated with bandwidths up to 3 kHz (piezo) and 37(3) kHz (current). The spectral linewidth of the free-running ECL was measured to be 22(2) kHz (Gaussian) and 4.2(3) kHz (Lorentzian) over 22.5 ms, while a long-term frequency stability better than 40(20) kHz over 11 hours was observed when locked to an atomic reference.},

The einstein equations; Assuming a two-level atom immersed in a light field with energy density $\rho(\omega)$, the atom is excited from state 1 to 2 at a rate proportional to $\rho(\omega_{12})$, assuming the atom only interacts with radiation near the resonant frequency (typical atomic resonant Q factors are of the order of ??) where $B_{12}$ is the proportionality constant. And Einstein introduced a stimulated emission process with proportionality $B_{21}$ in addition to the spontaneous rate $A_{21}$. Note that this stimulation is also responsible for the thermalization process in scattering; see counting statistics argument (if you can find it again). The rate equations are thus
$$
\frac{d N_2}{dt} = N_1B_{12}\rho(\omega_{12}) - N_2B_{21}\rho(\omega_{12}) - N_2A_{21}
$$
And because electron number is conserved, $\dot{N_1} = -\dot{N_2}$. Thus the decay is exponential when $\rho(\omega_{12})=0$, fixing $A_{21}=1/\tau$, which can be estimated classically as above. By considering such an atom immersed in the black-body radiation of a container which follows the Planck distribution, then the Boltzmann relation $p(s_1)/p(s_2) = exp(-\beta E_1)/exp(-\beta E_2)$  one gets the equilibrium population ratio $N_2/N_1 = \frac{g_2}{g_1}\exp(-\hbar\omega/k_B T)$, and can solve for $A_{21} = \hbar\omega^3/\pi^2 c^3 \times B_{21}$, $B_{12} = g_2B_{21}/g_1$.




Need to go back and find a good Zeeman source - but can leave this to cooling and trapping, probably

Helium, at last!

Beyond H, well, we need an array of new theoretical tools.

  title = {Foundation experiments in quantum atom optics with ultracold metastable helium},
  abstract = {The ﬁeld of atom optics has progressed rapidly over the past 20 years since the realisation of Bose-Einstein condensation, such that the wave behaviour of atomic gases is now routinely demonstrated. Furthermore, the study of quantum atom optics, which goes beyond a ‘mean-ﬁeld’ description of quantum systems to consider behaviour of single particles, has demonstrated both the similarities between photons and massive species, and the differences between the two as a result of the internal structure and external interactions of atoms. An important class of quantities which allow such effects to be measured are nth order correlation functions, which can be interpreted as a result of either particle or wave behaviour, and provide a statistical description of ﬂuctuations in n-tuples of particles in a source, which rigorously deﬁnes concepts such as coherence. The quantum statistics of a Bose-Einstein condensate should be the same as that for an optical laser, while an ideal thermal Bose gas matches the behaviour of an incoherent source of light. However, correlation measurements can also be used to quantify the inﬂuence of interactions, dimensionality, conﬁning potentials and waveguides, and the difference in quantum statistics between fermions and bosons, which illustrates the rich range of behaviour exhibited by atomic gases.},

Our experiment monitors ion production from the mixture for both magnetically polarized and unpolarized cases. In the unpolarized case, we observe an increase in our background ion rate. However, in the completely polarized sample the ion production is below the sensitivity of our experiment. Nonetheless, we determine an upper limit of 5 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 for the polarized rate constant (βRb−He∗), which is two orders of magnitude below the unpolarized rate constant. Such a suppression of the He∗–87Rb polarized rate was not apparent a priori and opens the intriguing possibility of creating a dual Bose–Einstein condensate comprising an alkali ground-state atom and an excited-state noblegas atom.},

The enhancement of the spatial third-order correlation function above a value of unity demonstrates the presence of spatial three-atom bunching, as expected for an incoherent source.},

              Bell correlations are a foundational demonstration of how quantum entanglement contradicts the classical notion of local realism. Rigorous validation of quantum nonlocality have only been achieved between solid-state electron spins, internal states of trapped atoms, and photon polarisations, all weakly coupling to gravity. Bell tests with freely propagating massive particles, which could provide insights into the link between gravity and quantum mechanics, have proven to be much more challenging to realise. Here we use a collision between two Bose-Einstein condensates to generate spin entangled pairs of ultracold helium atoms, and measure their spin correlations along uniformly rotated bases. We show that correlations in the pairs agree with the theoretical prediction of a Bell triplet state, and observe a quantum mechanical witness of Bell correlations with

  abstract = {We report the realisation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of metastable helium atoms using an in-vacuum coil magnetic trap and a crossed beam optical dipole trap. A novel quadrupole-Ioffe configuration (QUIC) magnetic trap made from in-vacuum hollow copper tubes provides fast switching times while generating traps with a 10G bias, without compromising optical access. The bias enables in-trap 1D doppler cooling to be used, which is the only cooling stage between the magneto-optic trap (MOT) and the optical dipole trap. This allows direct transfer to the dipole trap without the need for any additional evaporative cooling in the magnetic trap. The entire experimental sequence takes 3.3 seconds, with essentially pure BECs observed with \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ atoms after evaporative cooling in the dipole trap.},

Our experiments, carried out with a trapped-ion quantum simulator with partition sizes of up to 10 qubits, prove the overall coherent character of the system dynamics and reveal the growth of entanglement between its parts, in both the absence and presence of disorder. Our protocol represents a universal tool for probing and characterizing engineered quantum systems in the laboratory, which is applicable to arbitrary quantum states of up to several tens of qubits.},

The corresponding oscillatory motion is directly related to the intraband frequencies on a large range of lattice depths. Remarkably, for a moderate displacement, a single frequency dominates this oscillation for the zeroth and first order interference pattern observed after a sufficiently long time-of-flight. The method is robust against atom-atom interactions and the exact value of the extra external confinement of the initial trapping potential.},

In particular, the minimum r.m.s. atomic momentum is -6 single-photon momenta; this result wae not accessible to previous semi-classical treatments.},

We demonstrate the quantum state engineering of a strongly correlated many-body state of the two-component repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. Our scheme makes use of an ultralow entropy doublon band insulator created through entropy redistribution. After isolating the band insulator, we change the underlying potential to expand it into a half-filled system. The final many-body state realized shows strong antiferromagnetic correlations and a temperature below the exchange energy. We observe an increase in entropy, which we find is likely caused by the many-body physics in the last step of the scheme. This technique is promising for low-temperature studies of cold-atom-based lattice models.},

Low energy atomic collisions, which are short ranged in real space, relate to nearly infinite-ranged interactions in momentum space. However, the distinguishability of the discrete momentum states coupled in MSLs gives rise to an added exchange energy between condensate atoms in different momentum orders, relating to an effectively attractive, finite-ranged interaction in momentum space. We explore the types of phenomena that can result from this interaction, including the formation of chiral self-bound states in topological MSLs. We also discuss the prospects for creating squeezed states in momentum-space double wells.},

  abstract = {The transport of ultra-cold atoms in magneto-optical potentials provides a clean setting in which to investigate the distinct predictions of classical versus quantum dynamics for a system with coupled degrees of freedom. In this system, entanglement at the quantum level and chaos at the classical level arise from the coupling between the atomic spin and its center-ofmass motion. Experiments, performed deep in the quantum regime, correspond to dynamic quantum tunneling. This nonclassical behavior is contrasted with the predictions for an initial phase space distribution produced in the experiment, but undergoing classical Hamiltonian flow. We study conditions under which the trapped atoms can be made to exhibit classical dynamics through the process of continuous measurement, which localizes the probability distribution to phase space trajectories, consistent with the uncertainty principle and quantum ``back-action'' noise. This method allows us to analytically and numerically identify the quantum-classical boundary.}

We show how this unconventional approach opens up new opportunities to affect system evolution. We demonstrate how this can lead to a new class of final states different from those possible with dissipative state preparation or conventional projective measurements. These states are characterised by a combination of Hamiltonian and measurement properties thus extending the measurement postulate for the case of strong competition with the system's own evolution.},

  abstract = {As quantum computers improve in the number of qubits and fidelity, the question of when they surpass state-of-the-art classical computation for a well-defined computational task is attracting much attention. The leading candidate task for this quantum computational supremacy milestone entails sampling from the output distribution defined by a random quantum circuit. We perform this task on conventional computers for larger circuits than in previous results, by trading circuit fidelity for computational resources to match the fidelity of a given quantum computer. By using publicly available Google Cloud Computing, we can price such simulations and enable comparisons by total cost across multiple hardware types. We simulate approximate sampling from the output of a circuit with 7 \texttimes{} 8 qubits and depth 1 + 40 + 1 by producing one million bitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5\%, at an estimated cost of \$35184. The simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we estimate that extending circuit depth to 1 + 48 + 1 increases costs to one million dollars. Yet, for a quantum computer, approximate sampling would take seconds. We pay particular attention to validating simulation results. Finally, we explain why recently refined benchmarks substantially increase computation cost of leading simulators, halving the circuit depth that can be simulated within the same time.}

  pages = {40},
  abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, simultaneous eigenstates of the periodic Hamiltonian and of the direct lattice translations. An alternative representation in terms of localized orbitals has been introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937; besides its theoretical relevance in several areas of solid-state theory, it has gained recent prominence due to its connection with the Berry-phase theory of bulk polarization, the interest in linear-scaling approaches, and with the development of general algorithms to derive Wannier functions in the framework of first-principles electronic structure calculations. The connection between the Bloch representation and the Wannier representation is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. A few years ago we have developed a localization algorithm that allows one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs), extending and encompassing Boys formulation for molecules to the solid-state case. The localization algorithm is independent of the single-particle electronic structure approach adopted, or the choice of basis set, and it is straightforwardly applied to extended or periodic solids and to isolated systems. Additionally, a novel disentanglement procedure allows to extract a maximally-connected manifold of any chosen dimension from a given energy window, leading to the extension of the original algorithm to the case of systems without gaps (e.g., metals) and removing the limitation to isolated groups of bands separated by gaps from higher and lower manifolds. In this Highlight we will outline and summarize the main results of the theory and algorithm underlying the maximally-localized Wannierfunctions representation, and review some of the applications that have since appeared in the literature.}

  abstract = {Most of our knowledge of quantum phase transitions (QPTs){\textemdash}which occur as a result of quantum, rather than thermal, fluctuations{\textemdash}comes from experiments performed in equilibrium conditions. Less is known about the dynamics of a system going through a QPT, which have been hypothesized to depend on a single time and length scale. Clark et al. confirmed this hypothesis in a gas of cesium atoms in an optical lattice, which was shaken progressively faster to drive the gas through a QPT.Science, this issue p. 606The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.},

We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the resulting single-eigenstate statistical mechanics. We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.},

A particular care is devoted to the development of efficient numerical schemes for the quantum Boltzmann equation that preserve the main physical features of the continuous problem, namely conservation of mass and energy, the entropy inequality and generalized Bose-Einstein distributions as steady states. These properties are essential in order to develop numerical methods that are able to capture the challenging phenomenon of bosons condensation. We also show that the resulting schemes can be evaluated with the use of fast algorithms. In order to study the evolution of the condensate wave function the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is also presented together with some schemes for its efficient numerical solution.}

In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvevements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

Already a finite set of correlation functions can be sufficient to describe a quantum many-body system if correlations factorise, at least approximately. While being a powerful theoretical concept, an implementation based on experimental data has so far remained elusive. Here, this is achieved by applying it to a non-trivial quantum many-body problem: A pair of tunnel-coupled one-dimensional atomic superfluids. From measured interference patterns we extract phase correlation functions up to tenth order and analyse if, and under which conditions, they factorise. This characterises the essential features of the system, the relevant quasiparticles, their interactions and possible topologically distinct vacua. We verify that in thermal equilibrium the physics can be described by the quantum sine-Gordon model, relevant for a wide variety of disciplines from particle to condensed-matter physics. Our experiment establishes a general method to analyse quantum many-body systems in experiments. It represents a crucial ingredient towards the implementation and verification of quantum simulators.},

Finally, we have no definitive theory of high-temperature superconductivity.

While these phases were discovered in a solid-state setting, recent techniques have enabled the realization of gauge fields in systems of ultracold neutral atoms, offering a new experimental paradigm for studying these novel states of matter. This complementary platform holds promise for exploring exotic physics in fractional quantum Hall systems due to the microscopic manipulation and precision possible in cold atom systems. However, these experiments thus far have mostly explored the regime of weak interactions. Here, we show how strong interactions can modify the propagation of particles in a \$2\textbackslash times N\$, real-space ladder governed by the Harper-Hofstadter model. We observe inter-particle interactions affect the populating of chiral bands, giving rise to chiral dynamics whose multi-particle correlations indicate both bound and free-particle character.

  abstract = {Can high energy physics be simulated by low-energy, non-relativistic, many-body systems, such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles.},

  abstract = {These lecture notes were created for a graduate-level course on quantum simulation taught at Leibniz University Hannover in 2013. The first part of the course discusses various state of the art methods for the numerical description of many-body quantum systems. In particular, I explain successful applications and inherent limitations due to the exponential complexity of the many-body problem. In the second part of the course, I show how using highly controllable quantum system such as ultracold atoms will provide a way to overcome the limitations of classical simulation methods. I discuss several theoretical and experimental achievements and outline the road for future developments.},

  title = {Foundation experiments in quantum atom optics with ultracold metastable helium},
  abstract = {The ﬁeld of atom optics has progressed rapidly over the past 20 years since the realisation of Bose-Einstein condensation, such that the wave behaviour of atomic gases is now routinely demonstrated. Furthermore, the study of quantum atom optics, which goes beyond a ‘mean-ﬁeld’ description of quantum systems to consider behaviour of single particles, has demonstrated both the similarities between photons and massive species, and the differences between the two as a result of the internal structure and external interactions of atoms. An important class of quantities which allow such effects to be measured are nth order correlation functions, which can be interpreted as a result of either particle or wave behaviour, and provide a statistical description of ﬂuctuations in n-tuples of particles in a source, which rigorously deﬁnes concepts such as coherence. The quantum statistics of a Bose-Einstein condensate should be the same as that for an optical laser, while an ideal thermal Bose gas matches the behaviour of an incoherent source of light. However, correlation measurements can also be used to quantify the inﬂuence of interactions, dimensionality, conﬁning potentials and waveguides, and the difference in quantum statistics between fermions and bosons, which illustrates the rich range of behaviour exhibited by atomic gases.},
