To-do list:\newline
In \verb|{11_introduction.tex}|:
\begin{itemize}
\item {orientation dependence goes here}
\item {Add citations for dipole trap history}
\item {why is $a_{11}
\item {I don't quite understand why this follows from replacing the operators with complex numbers}
\end{itemize}
In \verb|{12_apparatus.tex}|:
\begin{itemize}
\item {[??] was done downstairs}
\item {basic mechanism of laser cooling in brief}
\item {by blocking line of sight to the MOT}
\item {be more specific, as the Zeeman effect is used all over the place}
\item {point to schematic}
\item {Is it just a pair of coils? I thought there was one on each window...}
\item {remove minutes claim or show some data}
\item {define what this is}
\item {Also, if it was close to resonance then you couldn't use AOMs to generate all the different frequencies we need for the many cooling and trapping beams}
\item {double check unused channel}
\item {Put this later/after the main exp schematic}
\item {description of TCP lock protocol}
\item {Probably need  a bit more detail in teh caption, especially as it doesn't all seem to be in teh main text.}
\item {Maybe put maintenance after this as it's defined the sat fluro, which is better than just a diagnostic, you can make accurate number measurements with it}
\item {Maybe include a figure showing this dark rate?}
\item {MCP-DLD schematic}
\item {Put figure closer, but keep on opposing pages}
\item {So what parameters do we use for our atom lasers then?  All this background is fine, but in a chapter on the experiment you need some more details of what our system actually has}
\item {put figures closer to references}
\item {Remove above para and fix flow}
\item {diagnostic figure}
\end{itemize}
In \verb|{30_manybody.tex}|:
\begin{itemize}
\item {How would you observe this?  What would it look like?}
\end{itemize}
In \verb|{31_depletion.tex}|:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?}
\item {cite more experiments}
\item {Density plots out to larger $|k|$ to show descent into noise floor? How far could we push it until we hit dark counts?}
\item {txy-to-vel vs linear error?}
\item {CHECK THIS 3.}
\item {Clarify \& graph of dark count statistics}
\item {Worst-case bias of -1 counts}
\end{itemize}
