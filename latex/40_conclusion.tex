This thesis describes work that consists of the following scientific
contributions: * Martin was wrong * New lines * Weakest transition *
Test of QED * Partial resolution of QD which didn't answer much and
isn't decisive re: theory * work towards a new regime of condensed
matter simulation

It is instructive to reflect on the efficiency of these machines as generators of quantum matter.
	The mass input is X to produce Y condensed atoms and detect only 10\% of them.
	The COP is complicated by the atom loss along the way but if we consider the change in energy of only the charge of atoms distilled to the BEC, then we find a COP of X.
	The duty cycle of about 30mHz means that even with large BECs the average flux rate is only X.
	These are low, but one would do well to recall that the first steam engines had efficiencies below 1\%, and several engineering breakthroughs later brought them towards several tens of percent, and gasoline engines followed a similar trend.
	In the production of BEC in the new machine, the duty cycle is reduced by a factor of ten and the atom number by a factor of two, an increase in the time-coherence product of a factor of twenty.
	The downscaling of helium condensate machines is a nontrivial challenge, but one is brought to wonder about the prospects of future fast-cycling, compact devices routinely creating and manipulating large quantum states.
	As James Watt could not conceive of the full implications of a developed rail network, we too are surely blind to the world we may be building


Lord Kelvin's famous remark - 'aside from two clouds, physics is done' - his arrogance aside, we are in a different position: Rather than a 'nearly done' job with a few details to work out, we are vividly aware of the sites of our ignorance.
	As Einstein (?) said, a well-formulated question contains its own answer; but we are still some ways from determining whether we are even asking the right questions!

A personal reflection.
	Was lured in to the academy by the promise of
questions like `what is the difference between simplicity and
complexity' - when are things simple? When is something intrinsically
hard to represent, even if it exists effortlessly in its own right? This
drew me to lattice - to build something with the hands that would be so
elusive for theory and computing.
	But yeah - that might have been
possible, but I hadn't the background to make reasonable progress in the
three year timeframe of an Australian PhD.
	Also, frankly, I didn't have
the tuition or support and so was left alone for most of the time,
crushing motivation and without praise and squirreled my time away in a
simulation that was much more to my theoretical tastes.
	But hey.
	I have
to find a nice way to dress this up.
	Most of these words won't make it.
So having got these ones out of the way, the hope is that I can move on
from them and think more deliberately about what it is that I would say
here.

The chronological order of work is reversed.
	I should perhaps detail the
actual sequence of events - and frame them as pragmatic decisions from
which I learned some useful things about scoping projects properly.
There isn't really much that window dressing can add here.
	But that's
okay - rather than telling the entire truth, just tell enough of it.
	But
don't let the complexity frighten you out of doing your best to be
honest, at least in this tiny sliver, the final vestiage of the
self-expression that you'd hoped you'd find the opportunity to explore.
This has been an exercise in shedding the ego, however incomplete that
process may yet remain.

\#\#\#A critical reading of science Technology evidently brings us great
things.
	But let us not lose sight of the implicit `right to know' - that
we still embody the notion of a conquest over nature, of mastery of the
other, the greater, the ultimately incomprehensible.
	Let us not fall
victim to our own arrogances, and recall that in our turbulent times,
our investigations come at cost.
	The nature of reality will, according
to our ultimate foundations, remain.
	But the conditions of society in
which we have the ability to pursue them are not guaranteed.
	One can
never predict the outcomes of discoveries, or what miraculous things may
be born of new technologies, but in the problem of allocating compute
power from human wetware - which still retains a certain je ne sais
quois that has not been replicated by industrial-scale algorithms
running in silico - we should be mindful of the hubris of endless
pursuit of the mastery of nature.
	This remains ingrained in our
mythology - that more advanced technology is always worth the price that
is paid.
	In the limit of free, clean energy and post-scarcity
manufacture whereby human labour is eliminated, this may be true.
	But,
unlike the atoms in this thesis, we do not live in vacuum.


\footnote{mathematical models - could be thought of as the quantitative storytelling part of humanity, the things that make it unique - and so there's something really sublime about the exactness of the correspondence with the world}, written extensively about in things like `the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics' and this correspondence is still explored in the problems of foundations of QM: what exactly does this mathematics say abotu the nature of the world? Why does it run this way? This deep inquiry will always be part of the human spirit, I think, but yeah.
