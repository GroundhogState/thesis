Section introduction\\
Statistical physics Phase transitions\\
Thermal, quantum, dynamical, computable, semantic Emergent complexity

The third section of this thesis transitions from the study of atomic
structure to the emergent dynamics of interacting systems. In teh old
essay `More is different', there is an argument that when you put a lot
of thigns together they start acting in genuinely novel ways. A single
water molecule is not wet - nor does it mean anything to say it is any
given phase, or that is has a temperature. (this is of course
problematic because it ascribes a specific state but the idea's there I
guess). So ya. One of the watershed(?) moments in the history of physics
was the \emph{derivation} of thermodynamics from statistical mechancics
- the assumption of a set of postulates about the microscopic nature of
the world that led through the law of large numbers to a new
understanding of empirical laws of the past; this gave a framework to
understand and extend thermo, and it was a triumph to provide systematic
ways to determine macro physics from teh nature of interactions. What
was more profouond was the discovery of universality classes - that at
phase boundaries there were unifying properties across disparate
systems, things that tied together quite general phenomena in terms of
these scaling relationships. This is kind of garbled. But yeah, look, we
have agaaghagha this is just insane rambling - I wonder if I can push to
10k words in the process of smooshing out all this. Not an entirely
honest drive if I'm honest but w/e the thing is I'm here and I'm writing
even if it's completely useless and will get trashed. This is a start,
even if it's bogus and hard. Anyhow back to progress. So ya -
statistical mechnics also provided an actual understanding of
temperature as a sublime phenomenon in all the emergent phenomenon -
that really, at the end of the day, thermal equlibrium and the
`spontaneous' processes we see in nature are just outcomes of,
basically, the law of large numbers. Phase transitions have been noted
in all kinds of places now; the BEC transitiion is a classical phase
transition. The idea is that an \emph{order parameter} changes value
from zero - representing a kind of disorganization - to something
nonzero, representing an emergent order. These come in different
flavours and in different systems but tied together by their scaling
laws - universality classes. Something really beautifully profound
there. And of course, pepole have tried to take the numinous idea of the
phase transition, of the \emph{qualitative} change in the emergent
properties of otherwise unchanged constituents, just by fiddling how
they relate to each other - and staple it to all kinds of things. People
talk of phase transitions in general network theory, presumably in
social dynamics, and more recently even in the study of grammars,
arguing that meaningful language corresponds to a marked phase
transition in lexical trees. But turning back from flights of fancy -
thermodynamics unified these ideas (in the earlier days) with the idea
of \emph{Free energy} which has since run rampant. But the idea is that
- well, if you have tunable parameters, then are there different
solutions to some equation? How do you wind up with these multiple
free-energy landscapes from a microscopic basis? Or do you need to
staple models toether? Idk, this would have been a great topics for a
PhD, hey?

Regardless. The idea is that we should probably add more signposts to
this meandering mess. I want to lead from classical phase transitions to
order parameters - using BEC as an example, identify its universality
class, no need to list off a ton or ramble about them too much. Then say
hey, once you're in the ground state, you have different kinds of phase
transitions. Quantum phase transitions, which aren't driven thermally or
by statistical laws but by the structure of the gruond state, and they
were first observed in an optical lattice. Free energy comes up as
should correlations, I think, as they both come hand in hand with order
etc.


Information In which the prospects of a quantum simulator are outlined. Beginning
with the discussion of a qubit and then the purity of states, the quantum analog
algorithms will be described. The necessity of state purity i.e. low entropy should
be discussed, and the question of realizing a high-purity quantum register should be
suggestively posed.

the content of any field theories describing the composite system. Where possible,
connections should be drawn to the preceding chapter, and also to experimental
considerations which will be treated in the next chapter.

Neural Networks In which any work done on representation of the quantum system is
decribed, along with precursors to any calculations done with these methods. In
this section, connections should be drawn between deep learning/state representation/
tensor networks/renormalization/state production/physical computation. It's
the dream. It's where it all comes together, but also the chapter that will be the
hardest or least likely to produce.
