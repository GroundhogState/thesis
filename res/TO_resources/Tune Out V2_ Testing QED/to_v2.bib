  Abstract                 = {Using the unique detection properties offered by metastablehelium atoms we have produced high resolution images of the transversespatial profiles of an atom laser beam. We observe fringes on the beam,resulting from quantum mechanical interference between atoms that startfrom rest at different transverse locations within the outcoupling surfaceand end up at a later time with different velocities at the same transverseposition. Numerical simulations in the low output-coupling limit give goodquantitative agreement with our experimental data.},

The unique feature of metastable helium atoms, the production of ions in the atom laser outcoupling process, is exploited to actively control the spatial location inside the Bose-Einstein condensate where outcoupling occurs. Unlike alkali atom lasers, this provides almost instantaneous feedback which reduces frequency, amplitude and spatial mode fluctuations in the atom laser beam.},

It was found that the isotropic RF outcoupling of atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate does not result in decoherence, while the `bunching' typical of incoherent sources was observed for thermal atoms. This new method significantly increases data acquisition rates compared to previous measurements, and also permits future novel experiments which may allow us to probe processes such as the birth and death of a condensate by monitoring correlation effects.},

abstract={Improvements in both theory and frequency metrology of few-electron systems such as hydrogen and helium have enabled increasingly sensitive tests of quantum electrodynamics, as well as ever more accurate determinations of fundamental constants and the size of the nucleus. At the same time, advances in cooling and trapping of neutral atoms have revolutionized the development of increasingly accurate atomic clocks. Here, we combine these fields to reach very high precision on an optical transition in the helium atom by employing a 4He Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a magic wavelength optical dipole trap. The measured transition accurately connects the ortho- and parastates of helium and constitutes a stringent test of quantum electrodynamics theory. In addition, we test polarizability calculations and ultracold scattering properties of the helium atom. Finally, our measurement lays the foundation for a determination of the 3He-4He nuclear charge radius difference with an accuracy exceeding that of muonic helium measurements currently being performed in the context of the proton radius puzzle.},

One possible resolution could be that electrons interact with protons in a different way than muons do, which would require {\textquotedblleft}new physics.{\textquotedblright} Bezginov et al. measured the Lamb shift in electronic hydrogen, which allowed for a direct comparison to the Lamb shift measured in muonic hydrogen. The two results agreed, but the discrepancy with the averaged value remains.Science, this issue p. 1007The surprising discrepancy between results from different methods for measuring the proton charge radius is referred to as the proton radius puzzle. In particular, measurements using electrons seem to lead to a different radius compared with those using muons. Here, a direct measurement of the n = 2 Lamb shift of atomic hydrogen is presented. Our measurement determines the proton radius to be rp = 0.833 femtometers, with an uncertainty of {\textpm}0.010 femtometers. This electron-based measurement of rp agrees with that obtained from the analogous muon-based Lamb shift measurement but is not consistent with the larger radius that was obtained from the averaging of previous electron-based measurements.},

abstract={Considering that the proton is a basic subatomic component of all ordinary matter -- as well as being ubiquitous in its solo role as the hydrogen ion H+ -- there are some surprising gaps in our knowledge of its structure and behaviour. A collaborative project to determine the root-mean-square charge radius of the proton to better than the 1\% accuracy of the current 'best' value suggests that those knowledge gaps may be greater than was thought. The new determination comes from a technically challenging spectroscopic experiment -- the measurement of the Lamb shift (the energy difference between a specific pair of energy states) in 'muonic hydrogen', an exotic atom in which the electron is replaced by its heavier twin, the muon. The result is unexpected: a charge radius about 4\% smaller than the previous value. The discrepancy remains unexplained. Possible implications are that the value of the most accurately determined fundamental constant, the Rydberg constant, will need to be revised -- or that the validity of quantum electrodynamics theory is called into question.},

Now, Beyer et al. shed light on this puzzle (see the Perspective by Vassen). The authors obtained the size of the proton using very accurate spectroscopic measurements of regular hydrogen. Unexpectedly, this value was inconsistent with the average value of previous measurements of the same type. Also unexpectedly, it was consistent with the size extracted from the muonic hydrogen experiments. Resolving the puzzle must now include trying to understand how the old results relate to the new, as well as reexamining the sources of systematic errors in all experiments.Science, this issue p. 79; see also p. 39At the core of the {\textquotedblleft}proton radius puzzle{\textquotedblright} is a four{\textendash}standard deviation discrepancy between the proton root-mean-square charge radii (rp) determined from the regular hydrogen (H) and the muonic hydrogen ({\textmu}p) atoms. Using a cryogenic beam of H atoms, we measured the 2S-4P transition frequency in H, yielding the values of the Rydberg constant R$\infty$ = 10973731.568076(96) per meterand rp = 0.8335(95) femtometer. Our rp value is 3.3 combined standard deviations smaller than the previous H world data, but in good agreement with the {\textmu}p value. We motivate an asymmetric fit function, which eliminates line shifts from quantum interference of neighboring atomic resonances.},

The measurement was performed at Jefferson Lab (JLab) in Hall A using recoil polarimetry. With a total uncertainty of approximately 1%, the new data clearly show that the deviation of the ratio μpGE/GM from unity observed in previous polarization measurements at high Q2 continues down to the lowest Q2 value of this measurement. The updated global fit that includes the new results yields an electric (magnetic) form factor roughly 2% smaller (1% larger) than the previous global fit in this Q2 range. We obtain new extractions of the proton electric and magnetic radii, which are 〈rE2〉1/2=0.875±0.010 fm and 〈rM2〉1/2=0.867±0.020 fm. The charge radius is consistent with other recent extractions based on the electron–proton interaction, including the atomic hydrogen Lamb shift measurements, which suggests a missing correction in the comparison of measurements of the proton charge radius using electron probes and the recent extraction from the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift."

abstract = {We report a new absolute frequency measurement of the Cs 6s-8s two-photon transition measured using frequency comb spectroscopy. The fractional frequency uncertainty is 5{\texttimes}10{\textminus}11, a factor of 6 better than previous results. The comb is derived from a stabilized picosecond laser and referenced to an octave-spanning femtosecond frequency comb. The relative merits of picosecond-based frequency combs are discussed, and it is shown that the AC Stark shift of the transition is determined by the average rather than the much larger peak intensity.},

The error budget for this scheme is presented, and we prove that the transition frequency obtained from the Cs cell at room temperature and with one-layer \&\#x3BC;-metal shielding is already very near that for the condition of zero collision and zero magnetic field. We point out that a sophisticated linewidth measurement could be a good guidance for choosing a suitable Cs cell for better frequency accuracy.},

This chapter discusses optical dipole traps for neutral atoms. Methods for storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents a particularly interesting situation, because Bose–Einstein condensation seems attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms. Further, optical dipole traps can be seen as storage devices at the low end of the presently explorable energy scale. Future experiments exploiting the particular advantages of these traps can reveal interesting new phenomena.}

The high-resolution spectroscopic study of some molecular excited states populated by photoassociation of cold atoms (photoassociative spectroscopy) gives a good illustration of this property. It provides accurate determinations of atomic radiative lifetimes, which are known to be sensitive tests for atomic calculations. A number of such analyses have been performed up to now, for all stable alkali atoms and for some other atomic species (Ca, Sr, Yb). A systematic review of these determinations is attempted here, with special attention paid to accuracy issues.}

Thus, the frequency interval was nearly tripled, in which photoassociation was observed compared to previous measurements. The spectra were analyzed by means of quantum mechanical simulations. With the new data it was possible to resolve the discrepancy concerning the ground state scattering length presented in earlier publications [Phys. Rev. A 67, 043408 (2003); Eur. Phys. J.

The interaction kernel of the equation is derived according to the method of Martin and Schwinger. The corrections are carefully calculated by the method which is free from any doubt. The result is expressed in terms of non-relativistic eigenfunctions. It is found for α5mc2 corrections that correction factors for spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings are in complete agreement with those derived by G. Araki on the basis of a simple consideration. Since α4mc2 corrections often gave rise to confusions and discussions among many authors these corrections are carefully examined. It is found on the firm basis that the α4mc2 terms involve a contact interaction but not the Breit surplus term. Further it is found that the energy correction for the excited bound state includes an imaginary part. Of course the ground-state energy is real. In fact the absolute value of the imaginary part represents half the width of the level in question. A discussion for this fact is given.}",

ABSTRACT = {The precise estimation of atomic polarizabilities impinges upon a number of areas and processes in physical science. We calculate precisely the dynamic multipole polarizabilities of the helium and screened-helium atoms using highly correlated exponential wavefunctions based on the pseudo-state summation method. For screened environments, we consider the Debye&ndash;H&uuml;ckel potential (DHP) as the interaction potentials between the charged particles. The dynamic multipole (quadrupole, octupole, and hexadecapole) polarizabilities for the ground state of the helium atom and the multipole (quadrupole and octupole) polarizabilities of the screened-helium atom for different screening parameters are reported along with magic-zero wavelengths. The reported results for hexadecapole polarizability of the helium atom and dynamic multipole polarizability of the screened-helium atom are new and would be useful for future investigation on this topic.},
