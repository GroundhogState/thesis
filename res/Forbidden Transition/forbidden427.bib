In particular, helium spectroscopy has played a crucial role in describing two-electron interactions, determining the fine-structure constant and extracting the size of the helium nucleus. Here we present a measurement of the doubly forbidden 1557-nanometer transition connecting the two metastable states of helium (the lowest energy triplet state 2 3S1 and first excited singlet state 2 1S0), for which quantum electrodynamic and nuclear size effects are very strong. This transition is weaker by 14 orders of magnitude than the most predominantly measured transition in helium. Ultracold, submicrokelvin, fermionic 3He and bosonic 4He atoms are used to obtain a precision of 8 {\texttimes} 10-12, providing a stringent test of two-electron quantum electrodynamic theory and of nuclear few-body theory.},

	abstract = {An experiment is proposed to excite the “forbidden” 1s2s 3S1 - 1s2s 1S0 magnetic dipole (M1) transition at
1.557 μm in a collimated and slow atomic beam of
metastable helium atoms. It is demonstrated that an excitation
rate of 5000 −1 can be realised with the beam of a
2 W narrow-band telecom fiber laser intersecting the
atomic beam perpendicularly. A Doppler-limited sub-MHz 
spectroscopic linewidth is anticipated. Doppler-free
excitation of 2% of trapped and cooled atoms may be realised in 
a one-dimensional optical-lattice geometry, using the 2 W laser both
for trapping and spectroscopy. 
The very small (8 Hz) natural
linewidth of this transition presents an opportunity for accurate
tests of atomic structure
calculations of the helium atom. A measurement of the
3He-4He isotope shift allows for accurate determination of
the difference in nuclear charge radius of both isotopes.}

abstract={Improvements in both theory and frequency metrology of few-electron systems such as hydrogen and helium have enabled increasingly sensitive tests of quantum electrodynamics, as well as ever more accurate determinations of fundamental constants and the size of the nucleus. At the same time, advances in cooling and trapping of neutral atoms have revolutionized the development of increasingly accurate atomic clocks. Here, we combine these fields to reach very high precision on an optical transition in the helium atom by employing a 4He Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a magic wavelength optical dipole trap. The measured transition accurately connects the ortho- and parastates of helium and constitutes a stringent test of quantum electrodynamics theory. In addition, we test polarizability calculations and ultracold scattering properties of the helium atom. Finally, our measurement lays the foundation for a determination of the 3He-4He nuclear charge radius difference with an accuracy exceeding that of muonic helium measurements currently being performed in the context of the proton radius puzzle.},

This new method significantly increases data acquisition rates compared to previous measurements, and also permits future novel experiments which may allow us to probe processes such as the birth and death of a condensate by monitoring correlation effects.},

The text is especially written for the interested reader without any particular knowledge in this field of research. It is thus ideal as an introductory reading to get a broad overview of the various different aspects of the field; in addition, it can serve as a guideline for future research. An introductory part is provided, giving a historic context and explaining the fundamental concept of clocks. Finally, potential candidates for nuclear clocks other than 229Th are discussed.",

	abstract = {The discrepancy between the proton size deduced from the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen and the average, textbook value based on regular (electronic) hydrogen has puzzled physicists for nearly a decade. One possible resolution could be that electrons interact with protons in a different way than muons do, which would require {\textquotedblleft}new physics.{\textquotedblright} Bezginov et al. measured the Lamb shift in electronic hydrogen, which allowed for a direct comparison to the Lamb shift measured in muonic hydrogen. The two results agreed, but the discrepancy with the averaged value remains.Science, this issue p. 1007The surprising discrepancy between results from different methods for measuring the proton charge radius is referred to as the proton radius puzzle. In particular, measurements using electrons seem to lead to a different radius compared with those using muons. Here, a direct measurement of the n = 2 Lamb shift of atomic hydrogen is presented. Our measurement determines the proton radius to be rp = 0.833 femtometers, with an uncertainty of {\textpm}0.010 femtometers. This electron-based measurement of rp agrees with that obtained from the analogous muon-based Lamb shift measurement but is not consistent with the larger radius that was obtained from the averaging of previous electron-based measurements.},

abstract = {Collisions of ultracold atoms can now be investigated in the laboratory at temperatures below 0.001 K. Such collisions are qualitatively different in many ways from collisions at normal energies, where T ≫ 1 K, because of the long time and distance scales associated with such collisions. Spontaneous emission can strongly modify collision dynamics of excited-state species produced by near-resonant optical excitation if the temperature is less than the characteristic temperature TS, where the collision time is comparable with the spontaneous-emission lifetime. We also estimate the temperature TQ that is characteristic of the onset of quantum threshold behavior, where the WKB approximation fails to apply as the de Broglie wavelength becomes large. We find that TQ is generally larger than TD, the Doppler cooling limit, except for collisions controlled by long-range potentials varying as 1/R3.TQ may be larger or smaller than TS. Expressions for estimating the magnitude of rate coefficients in the T {\textrightarrow} 0 limit are given. As an example, a model for the threshold behavior of Penning ionization of two He 3S1 metastable atoms is given, and the threshold rate coefficient is estimated to be \&gt;5 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}10 cm3 sec{\textminus}1.},

The tabulated transition rates and oscillator strengths include corrections for singlet-triplet mixing and spin-orbit coupling, but not the higher order relativistic terms nor the finite nuclear mass, although the latter are tabulated for future use. The results are consistent with laboratory lifetimes and oscillator strengths, but very few measurements are accurate enough to be stringent tests. An Appendix discusses the corrections for finite nuclear mass.}

These radii may be extracted from the laser spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen (μp, that is, a proton orbited by a muon). We measured the 2S1/2F=0-2P3/2F=1 transition frequency in μp to be 54611.16(1.05) gigahertz (numbers in parentheses indicate one standard deviation of uncertainty) and reevaluated the 2S1/2F=1-2P3/2F=2 transition frequency, yielding 49881.35(65) gigahertz. From the measurements, we determined the Zemach radius, rZ = 1.082(37) femtometers, and the magnetic radius, rM = 0.87(6) femtometer, of the proton. We also extracted the charge radius, rE = 0.84087(39) femtometer, with an order of magnitude more precision than the 2010-CODATA value and at 7σ variance with respect to it, thus reinforcing the proton radius puzzle.},

abstract = "Quantitative agreement with experimental data for adsorption of argon, krypton, and methane in high-silica zeolites is achieved with a molecular model, which (1) assumes pairwise additivity of intermolecular forces; (2) ignores partially concealed silicon atoms and lumps their dispersion energy with the oxygen atoms; (3) neglects energy induced by the weak electric field inside silicalite; (4) uses the Lennard–Jones 12-6 potential for gas–gas and gas–solid interactions. The parameters of the Ar–O gas–solid potential are ε/k=93.0 K and σ=3.335 Å. The gas–solid potential parameters for krypton and methane were calculated from the Ar–O reference potential using Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rules and the principle of corresponding states. The pore volume of silicalite determined from the He–O potential is 0.175 cm3 g−1. The local density of gases adsorbed in the pores varies with the strength of the gas–solid potential; at 306 K and 10 bar, the maximum absolute density of methane is about one half the density of liquid methane at its normal boiling point."

The fractional frequency uncertainty is 5{\texttimes}10{\textminus}11, a factor of 6 better than previous results. The comb is derived from a stabilized picosecond laser and referenced to an octave-spanning femtosecond frequency comb. The relative merits of picosecond-based frequency combs are discussed, and it is shown that the AC Stark shift of the transition is determined by the average rather than the much larger peak intensity.},

With the use of a single electro-optical crystal, we simultaneously narrow the laser linewidth, lock the laser frequency, and resolve a narrow spectrum point by point. The error budget for this scheme is presented, and we prove that the transition frequency obtained from the Cs cell at room temperature and with one-layer \&\#x3BC;-metal shielding is already very near that for the condition of zero collision and zero magnetic field. We point out that a sophisticated linewidth measurement could be a good guidance for choosing a suitable Cs cell for better frequency accuracy.},
