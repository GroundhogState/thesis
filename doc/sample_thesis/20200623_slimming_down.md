1. Introduction
	Background
	Theory
2.	Apparatus
3. Transition frequencies
	## 2P-5L transitions
	## Forbidden transition
4. Quantum depletion
	Expect this to be more or less complete content-wise by end July.
	Some editing may be required or desired. Budget 2 weeks AFTER paper submission etc.
5. Optical lattice
	Will need to spend some days in the lab taking data, I suspect, and looking through old dumps for RGA logs and stuff. That could be kinda nice. 
6. Conclusion
	Write this last. Allow two weeks, this section is short and most 'future work' will be included in the preceding chapters. 

So. Based on below I might even be able to get away with
	* Transitions (inc forbidden)
	* Depletion
	* Lattice
	* consider tuneout as a 'bonus' chapter (but really you'd be better off putting that time into some lattice sims if you really want to put more effort in)
Which leaves the following tasks:
	Write and submit QD paper - end July
	Introduction - perhaps start in July depending on detail of QD changes needed
	

	Forbidden section - would this be necessary, strictly? In the spirit of cutting as much as possible...

	

What goes in a thesis? Let's look at some others
	Davis 2001 
		1 Introduction (basic concepts)
		2 Domain-specific stuff (hamiltonians, GPEs, etc)
		3-6 original work
		7 conclusions
		150 pages + 37 page appendices
	Greiner 2003
		Not really a fair comparison but let's see
		1. intro (short!)
		2 introduction
			Theory and experiment in 17 pages
		3-4 main work
		6 outlook
		105 pages (!!!) and a ten-page appendix
	Campbell 2006
		1 introduction
		2 lattice theory 
		3-6 main work
		7 brief extra work
		8 conclusion
		108 pages and 20 pages of appendix
	Yoon 2009
		A building thesis!
		only five chapters total
		Intro, cooling and trapping, apparatus, and magnetic transport (conclusion)
		112 pages and 14 page appendix
		Appendices include AOM, feshbach resonances, and timing diagrams
		That said, there is a lot of data in the experiment parts
	Schneider 2011
		Oh, this is a big one.
		Introduction spans 5-6 chapters on various topics, some 93 pages
		Then three major works (some 50 pages) and some additional material (challenges and conclusion)
		156 pages
		20 pages of appendix
	Bakr 2011
		Guy built a QGM nice one
		Intro in 3 chapters (general, quantum phase transitions, bosons in lattices)
		Experimental apparatus (which he built I guess)
		Two experiments
		conclusion
		123 pages, 3 page appendix
	Hodgman 2011
		A single bulk introduction over 30 pages
		4 major chapters each ~30 pages
		147 pages
		What about relation to publications?
			lifetime measurements chapter connects to two papers (1st auth)
			HBT chapter relates to a second-auth paper
				Manning's thesis also included this, but hodgman does so in some detail
			correlations refers to 1st auth paper
			Matterwave chapter refers to three papers, all second-auth behind Dall
	Struck 2013
		Has 6 pubs, is 1st auth on 3, 2nd auth on 1,
		Intro is 3 chapters
		General (short)
		Bosons in optical potentials
		Driven lattices
		Main works 
			Frustrated XY simulation
			Gauge potentials
			Ising-XY models
			'towards' SO coupling
		85 pages !!! 
		and 20 pages of appendix
