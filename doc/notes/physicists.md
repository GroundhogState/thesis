Random physicists and their relevance;

Democritus for atoms!
Herschel for spectroscopy
Rydberg & Balmer, OG atomic spectra
Pauli for the exclusion principle?

# Some that may yet be giants
Not all scientists are giants whose shadow we may see with stark outline in the centuries following their passing. But every scientist draws upon the work of diligent and curious others, some of which I will chronicle here, especially those whose names make repeated appearances throughout this thesis.

Eric Braaten 
	carried out his graduate work in theoretical high-energy physics at the University of Wisconsin, receiving his Ph.D. in 1981. After postdoctoral positions at University of Florida and Argonne National Laboratory, he took a faculty position at Northwestern University in 1995, where he conducted ground-breaking research on quantum chromodynamics. He moved to Ohio State University in 1995, where he has branched out into the field of ultracold atoms. Dr. Braaten was awarded the Humboldt Research Prize in 2009, and is now visiting the Bethe Center for Theoretical Physics at Bonn University. He continues to work on both low-energy and high-energy problems in elementary particle physics and on both few-body and many-body aspects of ultracold atoms.
