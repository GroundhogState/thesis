RGL [24] Prior hamiltonian neglects nuclear recoil effects, which are small as m_e/M_He are of order 1e-4, and corrections can be expanded in powers of this. It also neglects relativity. The leading term in a series expansion in powers of alpha (sqrt(2h c R_inf/m_e c^2)) is the Breit-Pauli hamiltonian [24] which comes from the Dirac equation This term couples the electron spins to the OAM (and nuclear spin for 3He), lifting the degeneracy between the AM states and producing the fine structure splitting.

RGL [30,31] Second-and-higher QED corrections must include the vacuum fluctuations, which leads to the Lamb shift in H [29], and so the energy of He states can be written as a double sum in powers of (m_e/M) and alpha where the double-zero term is the non-rel energy, and many terms have been calculated (orders given in text) [30,31]

RGL Overlap of e- and nuclear wavefunctions give rize to a contact interaction of a given size (eq 1.7) - largest for S states but small for nonzero OAM - and this coupling leads to the isotope shift, but theory not accurate to enough to determine the S state energies precisely enough to test, but the isotope shift is [refs]
