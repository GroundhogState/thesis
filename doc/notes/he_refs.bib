Wave nature of atoms demonstrated in 1930 [9] and in 1933, the first optical manipulation (a slight deflection of a sodium beam) was performed by Frish [10]. 
Hydrogen not as yet controlled with optical techniques for lack of lasers at 121nm ground state transition
Unlike alkali, which have closed inner shells under the valence elctron, He* has an open S state, which leads to the ortho- and para-states. Both excited S states are forbidden to decay by the $\Delta L = \pm1$ rule, but the metastable one also because it requires a spin flip, giving rise to long lifetime. 
Metastable is longest lived excited state of any atomic or molecular species
The 1083nm transition is readily accessible by cheap and high quality lasers and has a low recoil temp. low sat intens helps here too
The upper cooling state has a fast decay time which leads to low doppler temps
Sat intens = \pi h c/3\lambda^3 \tau, where \tau is lifetime, and the radiative force F = R\hbar k, for scat rate R, approaches 1/2\tau (because half of the atoms, on avg, are excited). Via F = ma, this gives a heckin' fast deceleration for He*.
Optical molasses presents a velocity-dependent 'friction' force, which is what allows the increase of phase space density using optical methods in violation of Liouville theorem
[26] there are near-unity detection efficiencies on MCP?? is it the DLD that kills it?
He ionization energy 24.58eV, so two He* have enough to ionize one

COld atoms started as a subfield of atomic physics and now touches othe rdomains including molecular physics, statistical physics, condensed matter, quantum information, and foundations experiment (a ref for each would be good)
Chin 2010 for Feshbch ref?
Kinetic energies of degenerate gases are 10-10eV in comparison to metastable energy
Lach and pachucki predict the lifetime of metastable
