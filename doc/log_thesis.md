Bootcamp day 3. Things going ok. Still managing to find more words to plop out.

Taking Inger's advice and taking some stock of things I've been putting off talking about with supervisors:
## Things to talk to supervisors about
	* Content: Some expts (particularly the transitions) sorta feel like a sham. Bad scientific practise. This salesmanship feels dishonest, makes it hard to maintain motivation. There was no valuable contribution.
	* Didn't solve any interesting problems because of personal capacity of time to give - so in some senses a bit ashamed of the thesis in many levels, so far from goal/useful
	* What other writing blocks do I have? Obvs feeling like there are more crucial/urgent issues to work on outside of physics - feels like I had one good shot at something, missed, and now to pursue it would be counter to my values so there is a sense of loss here.
	* Exactly what goes in? For example, Kieran's derivation of the TO equation or Bryce's work on the fitting - they're essential to the project, so how much goes in? Should I make a full recount and then include a pre/post-amble about who contributed what to the project? 
	* What to include about the lattice?
	* why can't I shake the feeling that you just exploited my labour - the independence I've gained is almost despite you rather than because of you

1300-1400
	Basically nothing written. Fiddled with a few words. Growing discontent again. Considering the prospect that this would not be possible to put through, that it doesn't demonstrate sufficient work/smarts/number of problems solved in interesting/useful ways, just doing it for credibility & unlocking 'next thing' which might be all too late anyway, at least I feel a little proud of the effort/resilience expended but this hasn't seen me 'go rogue' in much sense, this is not hte physics i thought I wanted, this feels like staring at a wall, I'm blocked by something and maybe it's a ltitle too much coffee, maybe it's writing fatigue, maybe I overate, maybe I am genuinely running out of stuff to say in the thesis context, maybe need to read more, this was going to happen eventually but as soon as the flow state stops then the ugly head of self-doubt and self-criticism rears its head again. If I imagine speaking to myself, as another person say, what would I say? Mate you got ripped off for a couple of years then scraped through with a wooden fucking spoon no? Like this thesis is some kind of fucking consolation prize - of no consequence or use, I'll never be a cold atom physicist and I'll probably look back on the qualification as a silver fucking lining. Wow. I don't know whether this is anger or just exasperation. I'm dragging my feet it seems, petulantly whining about how its' not what I want it to be but there are real questions here about scientific integrity and intellectual honesty. I fell victim to a play by people who are good at the game but who share neither the curiosity nor the vision that I hoped to learn from. So what's left to learn here? Well, some quant methods, sure. I'll always be comparing myself to the leader and feeling like I'm falling behind. There

	Fuck this. I don't think I should keep ranting forever, go outside man this is beyond uncomfortable this is probably seriously counterproductive. Get some fresh air.
