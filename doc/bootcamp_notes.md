# First writing task:
This thesis builds on and contributes to work in the area(s) of:

* Precision spectroscopy of neutral atoms
* Effects of weak interactions in superfluids 
* Optical lattices for quantum simulation

The original contribution of my thesis is:
* Two methods for spectroscopy of ultracold atoms, specifically Helium
* A method to determine the oscillator strength of ultraweak transitions
* A measurement of a tuneout wavelength which validates the predictions of QED
* A demonstration that Bogoliubov theory is actually probably also OK, but then again the trap expansion dynamics aren't obvious.

1. Although studies in ultracold spectroscopy have examined excited state transitions there has not been methods of this sensitivity or background?. As such, this study provides additional insight into Ways to measure weak things.

2. Although studies in optical lattices have examined spin and configurations there has not been study of 1-body momentum correlations. As such, this study provides additional insight into *insert reasons people care about momentum correlations in condensed matter*.

This study is important to my dsicpline/community because:
* We want to understand superfluidity, and if the depletion behaves differently in Helium that would be important. 
* We want to understand wtf is going on with these proton radius measurements

But what excites ME the most about this study is:
* The opportunity to understand some more mathematics/statistical physics.
* The erstwhile chance to think about quantum/classical boundary and the complexity thing. But that's kind of dead.

This thesis does NOT:

(And that's okay)


# Exercise with Conal.

Write down a thought that's been troubling you.
	I haven't solved any of the interesting problems that our group has worked on. My work has been ancillary and is not recognized. I have more often been dragged away from opportunities to work on interesting problems.
Strategies:
	Imagine a bully/mean person saying the thoughts.
	Replay the thought. Say to yourself "I'm having the thought that... I notice that I'm having the thought that..."
	"Lemons lemons lemons"
	Word art.
Resilient folks:
	Tend to actively engage in physical and psychologial wellbeing. Clear relax and work times.
	Activate supports when needed.
	Hold flexible, balanced, and helpful views.
	Acknowledge and accept both their strenths and weaknesses non-judgmentally
	Connect with their values and goals, even at risk of failure.
