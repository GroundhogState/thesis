## Acknowledgements	

Well, this is about the time I start collecting some nice things to say to people who've stuck around. There will no doubt be more to add in future as I reflect on people's contributions.
I guess I don't need to mention ALL THE FRIENDS. Likely they won't read them. So maybe just include in the final draft submitted for feedback.

* Acknowledge the APS for financial support, and the ANU RSPE for financial and material support, LPC for the equipment and travel support, Piotr Deuar for arranging my visit to Warsaw and for extensive if intermittent collaborations
* Tim for the support in ventures both in research and in social philanthropy.
* Sean, Andrew & Ken for technical advice, and doing their best with what ultimately turned out to be a pretty difficult PhD. Thanks for taking me to Europe, I guess, but that did turn out to be a not so efficient trip. Was fun though. 
* David - for a compassionate ear, for infectious curiosity, for being a partner in crime for the rebellious act of self-studying from Schmacher & Westmoreland. You are painstakingly meticulous and that is something to learn from. 
* Bryce - I seem to learn something new from you each day. You struck me as very knowledgeable from the day I met you back when I was an aspiring theorist. Your attention to detail is maddening and yet I do find myself trying to learn from you in this sense. Your intuition is infuriatingly good, even if your arguments don't always stack up. Indeed you are the experimentalists' experimentalist. I daresay I picked up some bad work habits from you, but by the same token I have a great deal to thank you for in the conversations that brought me down to earth from hating the project, or whatever else was bothering me.
* Inger and V for their incisive wisdom, for elevating the soul, for helping me remember to believe in myself.
* To the kids across the pond - Richard, Jess, Patrick, Ethan - for the hikes and the hijinks.
* My housemates Morgan and Alice - the sage advice on surviving a PhD and how to make good decisions was good. Also knowing it was survivable. Seeing Alice's outward panic counterbalanced by her sticking of the landing in a most wonderful way - very good.
* To the humans outside the academy - Clair & Ridley for welcoming me to community (if complicated) - Brett and Erica for reminding me that my brain is something worth being excited about, Holly for the support in the early days and also some much-needed frankness about careers and relationships


To the inner circle, if you will - the life-support team.
* Geoff - for always thinking bigger
* Shane - for genuinely caring and checking in 
* Aqeel - for the counsel, and courting dropout but affirming bullish determination.

## Thesis Outline

This thesis documents three projects that were undertaken in the ANU Helium BEC laboratory over the period of 2018-2019 and one project, which remains unfinished, that was undertaken in 2016-2018. A number of other graduate students were in residence at the time, and each of them contributed variously to the experiments. These experiments constitute a chapter each, and conclude with acknowlegements of the contributions of each person involved. 
The chapters are arranged in such a way as to provide a progression through subjects of increasing complexity, and are separated into three parts. 

The first part includes a general introduction to ultracold atomic physics and an overview of the apparatus used to complete the experiments described in this thesis. 

The second part includes chapters 3 and 4, and concentrates on a pair of experiments regarding the atomic structure of Helium. The experiments in this section are motivated by open questions in atomic structure theory, and includes a review of essential concepts. Chapter 3 concerns a set of measurements of electronic absorption lines, which in some sense is the most elementary concept encountered in this thesis. Chapter 4 describes the measurement of a tune-out frequency in Helium, at which there is a null response of the atomic dipole induced by an oscillating electric field. Such tune-out frequencies are determined by the interplay of an array of atomic transitions, and so this chapter represents a marginal increase in complexity. Conversely, the signals sought in chapters 3 and 4 are presented in sequence of decreasing signal power, ultimately converging on a measurement of a null response, attempting to determine when *nothing* happens. 

Following these studies of the internal structure of atoms, the third part, consisting of chapters 5 and 6, is concerned with interacting systems. Chapter 5 describes a third completed project concerning the effects of weak interactions on the density and correlations of the momentum spectrum of ultracold Bose gases. This section includes an overview of the relevant physics of ultracold gases. Chapter 6 discusses the motivation for, and progress towards, an optical lattice trap for ultracold Helium. This was the initial project of my PhD, but after two years of work the decision was made to discontinue working to construct this apparatus. Chapter 7 presents a summary of the findings of all the projects in this thesis, presents future directions of research using ultracold helium, and concludes by unraveling the narrative thread of this thesis.

### Themes

Transitions - simplicity?
Tuneout - measuring zero - the only constant is change, so can anything really have *no* effect?
Depletion - stillness, and the impossibility thereof - vacuum fluctuations
Lattice - complexity

## Historical perspective	
Democritus

	Ok so somewhere in here I wax lyrical. We tend to try to understand things. Why? Well. There is something advantageuos about being able to make predictions bout the world. This is something that has enhanced our survival prospects. But in humans something seems to be running on overdrive. And, sure, this isn't really relevant to the thesis, but you want to start from somewhere that naturally lreads to a framing of atomic theory. 
	Matter is inescapable. Except perhaps in the dream state - we are surrounded by substance. Some two or so thousand years ago, Democritus posited that there was a smallest thing. That one could break mountains down into boulders, boulders down to stones, stones to sand, and sand... To something indivisible. He called them, literally, atomos, for indivisible. This was astoundingly prescient: The atomic theory, as it came to be known, would not find empirical validation for another millenia or so. And, like all theories that prove to be correct, it too reached its point of failure a few hundred years thereafter. The atomic theory was outlandish at the time, breaking with the notion that things were ultimately continuous. The exploration of the atomic world eventualyl yielded a new kind of understanding of everyday matter. 
Kinetic theory of gases, thermodynamics,  'absolute zero'

	The first profound successes were had with gases, laying the foundations for thermodynamics and the understanding of the extraction of energy from storage in chemical bonds, via heating a working fluid, say - and powering the steam revolution. Among the findings of the kinetic theory of gases was what later became known as an equation of state - an apparently universal relationship between macroscopic quantities - pressure, temperature, volume, and mass - expressing the balance of energy in gases. Among the findings that stem from this understanding was the notion of an absolute temperature scale: That if one could extract enough energy from a gas, by cooling it, then its internal energy would vanish. It would have no volume. It would be motionless. This prediction predated Einstein's formulation of the mass-energy equivalence, but even at the time, it was appreciated that gas molecules had to have a size. So they could not vanish simply by getting colder. This paradox took some years to resolve, and it was only possible by completely overturning the picture of the atom. While understanding thus far had stemmed from the investigation of matter, the first quantum revolution was to come from the study of light.
Spectra & old quantum theory

	Spectra are typically obtained by taking a beam of light - say, from a pinhole or slit in a mask - and passing it through a medium, such as glass, which disperses the light according to its colour. In modern parlance, there is a difference between the momentum (direction of travel) of light with different energies (related to frequency). It was by WHO? that spectra were first resolved with enough detail to distinguish more or less intense lines against an apparent continuum. And in particular, that pure elemental sources created different colours. A standard prism and screen would show different results with different elements. Wait - but by this point, we must have had an understanding of electrons, right? Because there was this Bohr model, where the electrons were orbiting the nucleus. And there was an understanding that moving charges radiated light - this was post-Maxwell, surely. Better go revise that history. So the upshot I guess would be that, anyway, there was a finding that the lines of light - oh also, the photoelectric effect which predicts that light are particles and have energy proportional to their wavelength, hey. So, this is how people worked out the energy gaps between the internal states of atoms that were later found to be related to inverse ratios of square integers: That led to the positing of a classical model, with a 1/r potential, that was inspired by the knowledge that potential energy fell off like 1/r^2. But did we get this backwards? Would have to revise the classical mechanics too, yikes. But yeah. The wise thing to do would be to talk angular momentum, and then from spectra we introduce Planck's idea of supposing that it *comes in units*. And then we add in the postulate of de broglie - where was this first verified? - and the double slit experiment, then the whole world turns just about on its head. And so was born the old quantum theory. Or something like that, go read Born and that Disney book for starters.
Modern QM, QFT?
	Presumably there will need to be some historical preamble, but the idea is now that we lay out the foundational pieces of quantum theory as we now understand it, or at least as it will be used in this thesis. This includes, and perhaps is motivated by an example, leading to a small exegesis of the thesis
		Hilbert spaces and quantum states
		Probability amplitudes
		Operators and observables
		Time evolution
		Composite systems
		Density matrices
		Interactions
		Correlations & Entanglement
	And a survey of the present state:
		Formulation of QED
			Lamb shift, Rydberg constant, etc etc?
		Extension to QFT
		Experimental successes
		Extension to condensed matter
		What's after the standard model? Unifying HEP/condensed matter/QI? Following the math doesn't seem to have worked for SUSY (and so one might take this as a cautionary tale for Everrett).

Quantum technology is a young term, but has been growing exponentially since used in print for the first time in about 1970 according to Google Ngram. Some have said that we live in the 'silicon age', in light of the pervasiveness of computing technology based on silicon substrates. What is perhaps less conventionally appreciated is that modern semiconductor technologies, including the transistor which is essential to the miniaturized computing devices available today, are a direct outcome of the first quantum revolution - that is, the conception of quantum mechanics and its associated ontological metamorphosis. Understanding gained since the conception of QM has led to myriad other technologies that foundationally depend on the quantum world. Nuclear magnetic resonance, for example, underpins the life-altering technology of magnetic resonance imaging and finds use in the study of biomolecular structure and industrial applications, forming multibillion dollar industries. A second prominent example is the laser, whose functioning depends on the quantum theory of light and matter. Of course, lasers will be extensively used through this thesis for the purposes of preparing and investigating ultracold samples of Helium, but outside of the atomic physics laboratory lasers are now used in fields as diverse as electromagnetic and gravitational astronomy, medicine, self-driving vehicles and robotics, cosmetics, manufacturing, remote sensing, and miltary use. Despite their foundational reliance on the quantum picture of the world, these technolgies may one day be seen as 'primitive' in the same way that a typewriter or vacuum tube is now. A second quantum revolution began with the creation and manipulation of single quantum states, for which Haroche and Wineland were awarede a Nobel, but includes technologies such as ion traps and coherent control mechanisms, and the still nascent technolgies of single-system state determination. These are still developing but have laid the foundations for the third quantum revolution, the large-scale engineering of quantum states by controllable interactions between multiple subsystems. The posterchild for such technologies is, of course, quantum computing. Notwithstanding ongoing controversy over the viability and usefulness of quantum computing, the challenge of large-scale quantum engineering has spurred an explosion of technical developments. Moreover, the growing prominence of quantum technology has drawn the curious eyes of computer scientists, who now join forces with physicists in attempts to unravel the basic structure of the cosmos from process-theoretic perspectives. Why is it, for example, so difficult to efficiently simulate quantum processes? Where is the border between efficient and intractable? The proof of genuine quantum advantages in certain processes may be one of the most profound statements about the nature of reality of this generation. Wherefore the nature of this advantage? Perhaps we will know before the century is out - perhaps, if ongoing crises arenot addressed - we will never know, and the cosmos may miss its chance to delve most deeply into its own self-awareness.

Digressions aside, a parallel stream of large-scale quantum engineering exists not in silico but in vacuo. The techniques of laser cooling to quantum degeneracy, established at the turn of the millenium, make quantum coherence (a topic to return to later) readily available and amenable to almost routine study. In the early days, cold gases were fantastic resources for studying atomic structure and basic interactions such as dimerization, because their low kinetic energies and densities dramaticall reduced the homogenous broadening effects that spectroscopy would otherwise be susceptible to. The development of advanced atomic clocks was a logical extension. In the later 90s though, Jaksch and Zoller proposed quantum simulation in optical lattices. Lattices themselves had been used before for some studies - check out Orzel for the work that *almost* got to the quantum phase transition - but yeah. That field is exploding now, with advances into microscopy and stuff. 

Both of these topics - metrology and many body physics - form the spine of this dissertation. Also known as - internal structure and interactions - precision measurement and quantum engineering - stuff like this.
