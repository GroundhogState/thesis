## Thesis structure	

	This thesis documents three projects that were undertaken in the ANU Helium BEC laboratory over the period of 2018-2019 and one project, which remains unfinished, that was undertaken in 2016-2018. A number of other graduate students were in residence at the time, and each of them contributed variously to the experiments. These experiments constitute a chapter each, and conclude with acknowlegements of the contributions of each person involved. 
	The chapters are arranged in such a way as to provide a progression through subjects of increasing complexity, and are separated into three parts. 

	The first part includes a general introduction to ultracold atomic physics and an overview of the apparatus used to complete the experiments described in this thesis. 

	The second part includes chapters 3 and 4, and concentrates on a pair of experiments regarding the atomic structure of Helium. The experiments in this section are motivated by open questions in atomic structure theory, and includes a review of essential concepts. Chapter 3 concerns a set of measurements of electronic absorption lines, which in some sense is the most elementary concept encountered in this thesis. Chapter 4 describes the measurement of a tune-out frequency in Helium, at which there is a null response of the atomic dipole induced by an oscillating electric field. Such tune-out frequencies are determined by the interplay of an array of atomic transitions, and so this chapter represents a marginal increase in complexity. Conversely, the signals sought in chapters 3 and 4 are presented in sequence of decreasing signal power, ultimately converging on a measurement of a null response, attempting to determine when *nothing* happens. 

	Following these studies of the internal structure of atoms, the third part, consisting of chapters 5 and 6, is concerned with interacting systems. Chapter 5 describes a third completed project concerning the effects of weak interactions on the density and correlations of the momentum spectrum of ultracold Bose gases. This section includes an overview of the relevant physics of ultracold gases. Chapter 6 discusses the motivation for, and progress towards, an optical lattice trap for ultracold Helium. This was the initial project of my PhD, but after two years of work the decision was made to discontinue working to construct this apparatus. Chapter 7 presents a summary of the findings of all the projects in this thesis, presents future directions of research using ultracold helium, and concludes by unraveling the narrative thread of this thesis.

## Historical perspective	
	Democritus

		Ok so somewhere in here I wax lyrical. We tend to try to understand things. Why? Well. There is something advantageuos about being able to make predictions bout the world. This is something that has enhanced our survival prospects. But in humans something seems to be running on overdrive. And, sure, this isn't really relevant to the thesis, but you want to start from somewhere that naturally lreads to a framing of atomic theory. 
		Matter is inescapable. Except perhaps in the dream state - we are surrounded by substance. Some two or so thousand years ago, Democritus posited that there was a smallest thing. That one could break mountains down into boulders, boulders down to stones, stones to sand, and sand... To something indivisible. He called them, literally, atomos, for indivisible. This was astoundingly prescient: The atomic theory, as it came to be known, would not find empirical validation for another millenia or so. And, like all theories that prove to be correct, it too reached its point of failure a few hundred years thereafter. The atomic theory was outlandish at the time, breaking with the notion that things were ultimately continuous. The exploration of the atomic world eventualyl yielded a new kind of understanding of everyday matter. 
	Kinetic theory of gases, thermodynamics,  'absolute zero'

		The first profound successes were had with gases, laying the foundations for thermodynamics and the understanding of the extraction of energy from storage in chemical bonds, via heating a working fluid, say - and powering the steam revolution. Among the findings of the kinetic theory of gases was what later became known as an equation of state - an apparently universal relationship between macroscopic quantities - pressure, temperature, volume, and mass - expressing the balance of energy in gases. Among the findings that stem from this understanding was the notion of an absolute temperature scale: That if one could extract enough energy from a gas, by cooling it, then its internal energy would vanish. It would have no volume. It would be motionless. This prediction predated Einstein's formulation of the mass-energy equivalence, but even at the time, it was appreciated that gas molecules had to have a size. So they could not vanish simply by getting colder. This paradox took some years to resolve, and it was only possible by completely overturning the picture of the atom. While understanding thus far had stemmed from the investigation of matter, the first quantum revolution was to come from the study of light.
	Spectra & old quantum theory

		Spectra are typically obtained by taking a beam of light - say, from a pinhole or slit in a mask - and passing it through a medium, such as glass, which disperses the light according to its colour. In modern parlance, there is a difference between the momentum (direction of travel) of light with different energies (related to frequency). It was by WHO? that spectra were first resolved with enough detail to distinguish more or less intense lines against an apparent continuum. And in particular, that pure elemental sources created different colours. A standard prism and screen would show different results with different elements. Wait - but by this point, we must have had an understanding of electrons, right? Because there was this Bohr model, where the electrons were orbiting the nucleus. And there was an understanding that moving charges radiated light - this was post-Maxwell, surely. Better go revise that history. So the upshot I guess would be that, anyway, there was a finding that the lines of light - oh also, the photoelectric effect which predicts that light are particles and have energy proportional to their wavelength, hey. So, this is how people worked out the energy gaps between the internal states of atoms that were later found to be related to inverse ratios of square integers: That led to the positing of a classical model, with a 1/r potential, that was inspired by the knowledge that potential energy fell off like 1/r^2. But did we get this backwards? Would have to revise the classical mechanics too, yikes. But yeah. The wise thing to do would be to talk angular momentum, and then from spectra we introduce Planck's idea of supposing that it *comes in units*. And then we add in the postulate of de broglie - where was this first verified? - and the double slit experiment, then the whole world turns just about on its head. And so was born the old quantum theory. Or something like that, go read Born and that Disney book for starters.
	Modern QM, QFT?
		Presumably there will need to be some historical preamble, but the idea is now that we lay out the foundational pieces of quantum theory as we now understand it, or at least as it will be used in this thesis. This includes, and perhaps is motivated by an example, leading to a small exegesis of the thesis
			Hilbert spaces and quantum states
			Probability amplitudes
			Operators and observables
			Time evolution
			Composite systems
			Density matrices
			Interactions
			Correlations & Entanglement
		And a survey of the present state:
			Formulation of QED
				Lamb shift, Rydberg constant, etc etc?
			Extension to QFT
			Experimental successes
			Extension to condensed matter
			What's after the standard model? Unifying HEP/condensed matter/QI? Following the math doesn't seem to have worked for SUSY (and so one might take this as a cautionary tale for Everrett).
