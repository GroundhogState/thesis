Metrology & Many-Body physics with ultracold He*

Noting that this thesis consists of fairly distinct but complete projects, the structure will vary from a traditional thesis. There are three complete measurements, and a report on the motivation and progress towards a project that was begun but eventually abandoned due to lack of resources. As such, there are three sections of the thesis - the introduction & background, the results of experiments in laser spectroscopy in Helium, and the results (& partial progress) of results in many-body physics with ultracold Helium. Each chapter will be somewhat self-contained, except where referring to concepts introduced in previous chapters. This structure may seem unconventional, but it seems impossible to construct a genuine unifying scientific motivation. I would be happy to learn of a more parsimonious option. Instead, I will present the results in a narrative manner that loosely respects my original motivations for commencing this PhD: The emergence of complexity from simplicity.

# Argument/key message:

# Introduction 

## Opening hook

In this thesis, we will get about as close to perfect stillness as physically possible. The fact of zero-point energy - that no quantum state can have definitevly zero momentum - cements a simple tenet: Nothing is stationary.
